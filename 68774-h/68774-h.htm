<h2 class="nobreak">TRANSLATOR’S NOTE</h2>
</div>


<p>With the exception of, perhaps, “Le
Feu” by Henri Barbusse, no book
made such a stir in the France of
1914-1918 as Georges Duhamel’s<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “Civilisation.”
Its success was as immediate as
its appeal was universal. Like “Le Feu,”
it was awarded the Prix Goncourt, and ran
to an enormous circulation.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, too, that posterity
will acclaim it as a remarkable work. For it
is something more than a human document
of the war. One feels in the poignant
experiences of the few French soldiers, depicted
by M. Duhamel, the tragic fate of
twentieth-century man&mdash;the Machine Age
man&mdash;in the grip of the scientific monster
he has created for himself. These intimate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>pictures have the cumulative effect of an
epic in which the experiment of humanity
is menaced by man’s own inventiveness and
heroism.</p>

<p>This impression is the creation of the
particular style of M. Duhamel. It is not
by the vigorous simplicity of a Guy de
Maupassant that he achieves his effects, nor
by the exact observation which one might
expect of him as a doctor of medicine. His
strength lies in the violent imagery with
which he intensifies his descriptions, giving
the impression of life and feeling to inanimate
objects. He thus often produces the effect
of a monstrous dream or nightmare.</p>

<p>Emile Zola was a past master of this
method; but, in his case, too often, the
subject did not lend itself to such treatment.
M. Duhamel does not lay himself open to
this objection. No style could be more
appropriate than his for expressing the cold
precision of the machinery by means of
which this so effectively organised war has
ruined our world.</p>

<p>Like Emile Zola, M. Duhamel does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
not shirk any detail however unpleasant.
Differences in language and point of view
make it impossible to reproduce all of these.
But with the exception of “Les Amours de
Ponceau” all the tales comprising “Civilisation”
are included in the translation.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to Miss Eva Gore-Booth
for kindly reading the proofs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A FACE</h2>
</div>


<p>A commanding and almost gracefully
shaped brow, a look that was
at once childish and profound, a
dimpled chin, a rather flaunting moustache,
a bitter expression about the laughing lips:
that French face I shall never forget, though
I saw it only for a second in the flickering
light of a match.</p>

<p>It was an autumn night in 1916. The
train which runs from Châlons to Sainte-Menehould
was making its return journey,
with all lights out. The Champagne front,
on our left, was then calm, sunk in volcanic
sleep: a sleep of nightmares, sudden alarms,
and sharp flashes. We pierced the darkness,
slowly crossing the wretched country, which
seemed in our mind’s eye to be even more
wretched and distorted by the hideous
machinery of war. The little train, with
cries of weariness, hobbled along with a
rather hesitating gait, like a blind man
traversing an accustomed road.</p>

<p>I was going back, my furlough being
over. Feeling rather ill, I lay on the seat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Opposite me, three officers were chatting.
Their voices were those of young men, but
in military experience they were veterans.
They were rejoining their regiment.</p>

<p>“This sector,” said one of them, “is
fairly quiet at present.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, there will be nothing doing
until the spring,” replied the other.</p>

<p>Silence followed, broken by the restless
clatter of the wheels running on the rails.
Presently we heard a young, laughing, satirical
voice saying, almost in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Oh! we shall be compelled to do some
mad thing before spring.”</p>

<p>Then, without any connecting remark,
the same man added:</p>

<p>“It will be my twelfth attack. But I
have always been lucky. I have only been
wounded once yet.”</p>

<p>These two phrases were still echoing in
my ears when the man who had uttered them
lighted a match and began smoking. The
light gave a furtive glimpse of a handsome
face. The man belonged to an honoured
corps. The insignia of the highest awards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
that can be given to young officers gleamed
on his yellow tunic. A quiet and discreet
courage emanated from his personality.</p>

<p>Darkness once more enfolded us. But
would there ever be a night black enough to
extinguish the image which then flashed
before me? Would there ever be a silence
so complete as to stifle the echo of the two
little phrases murmured amid the rattle of
the train?</p>

<p>Since that time I have often thought of
the incident whenever, as on that night, I
have turned, with love and anguish, towards
the past and towards the future of these men
of France&mdash;my brothers who, in such great
numbers, have given themselves up to die
and are not ashamed to utter the thoughts
that lie nearest the heart; whose nobility of
soul, and unyielding intelligence and pathetic
simplicity, the world appreciates too little.</p>

<p>How could I not think of it at a time
which saw the long martyrdom of a great
people, who, across a night without bourne,
search solely for the paths along which they
may at last find freedom and peace?</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">REVAUD’S ROOM</h2>
</div>


<p>One never got tired in Revaud’s room.
The roar of the war, the rumbling
of transport waggons, the spasmodic
shocks of the gunfire, all the whistling and
gasping sounds of the killing machine beat
against the windows with a spent fury,
as in the shelter of a creek resound the
echoes of a storm raging in the open sea.
But this noise was as familiar to the ear as
the heart-beats of the miserable world, and
one never got tired in Revaud’s room.</p>

<p>It was a long, narrow apartment where
there were four beds and four men. It
was, notwithstanding, called Revaud’s room,
because the personality of Revaud filled
it from wall to wall. It was just the size
for Revaud, exactly fitting like a tailor-made
coat. In the beginning of November
there had been all kinds of nasty intrigues
hatched by Corporal Têtard to get Revaud
removed elsewhere; and, the intrigues
succeeding, the poor man was taken up to
another storey and placed in a large dormitory
of twenty beds&mdash;a bewildering desert,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
no longer homely, but ravaged by a raw,
cruel light. In three days, by an involuntary
decision of his body and soul, Revaud had
got worse to such an alarming extent that
he had to be carried down with great haste
and placed behind the door in his own room,
where the winter light came filtering in, full
of kindliness.</p>

<p>And thus things remained; whenever a
seriously wounded man, an extraordinary
case, was brought to the division, Mme.
Baugan was asked to go and see Revaud
at once and “sound him on the question.”</p>

<p>Revaud pretended to make things rather
difficult at first, and ended by saying:</p>

<p>“Very well; I am quite willing. Put
the man in my room....”</p>

<p>And Revaud’s room was always full.
To be there, you had to have more than a
mere bagatelle of a wound: a broken foot,
or some trivial little amputation in the
arm. It was necessary to have “some
unusual and queer things”&mdash;a burst intestine,
for example, or a displaced spinal cord, or
yet cases in which “the skull has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
bent in or the urine doesn’t come out where
it used to before the war.”</p>

<p>“Here,” Revaud used to say with pride,
“there are only very rare cases.”</p>

<p>There was Sandrap, “who had to have
his needs satisfied through a hole in his
side”&mdash;Sandrap, a little man from the north,
with a round nose like a fresh apple, with
beautiful eyes of a delicate grey colour of
silk. He had been wounded three times, and
used to say every morning: “They’d be
surprised, the Boches, if they could see
me now.”</p>

<p>There was Remusot, who had a large
wound in the chest. It made a continual
Faoo aoo ... Raoo aoo ... Faoo ...
Raoo ...; and Revaud had been asking
from the first day:</p>

<p>“What a funny noise you’re making!
D’you do it with your mouth?”</p>

<p>In a hoarse voice he wheezed:</p>

<p>“It is my breath escaping between
my ribs.”</p>

<p>And lastly there was Mery, whose spine
had been broken by an aerial torpedo, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
who “no longer felt the lower part of his
body, as if it didn’t belong to him.”</p>

<p>All this little world was living on its
back, each in his place, in a promiscuous
atmosphere of smells, of sounds, and sometimes
of thought. The men recognised each
other by their voices rather than by their
faces; and there was one great week when
Sandrap was seen by Revaud as he was
being carried to the dressing-room in a
stretcher on a level with the bed, and the
latter exclaimed suddenly:</p>

<p>“Hallo! is that you, Sandrap? What
a funny head you have got! And your hair
is even funnier.”</p>

<p>Mme. Baugan came at eight o’clock, and
at once she began scolding:</p>

<p>“There’s a nasty smell about. Oh! Oh!
my poor Revaud, I’m sure you have
again&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Revaud avoided the question:</p>

<p>“Very fine, thanks. I’ve slept very well.
Nothing more to report. I’ve slept quite
well.”</p>

<p>Then Mme. Baugan drew back the sheets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
and, overcome by the sad and ignoble smell,
she muttered:</p>

<p>“Oh! Revaud! you are unreasonable.
Will you never be able to control yourself!”</p>

<p>Revaud could no longer dissemble. He
confessed phlegmatically: “Ah, it’s true
enough! But whatever you say, nurse, I
can’t help myself.”</p>

<p>Mme. Baugan came and went, looking for
fresh linen and water. She began to wash
him and dress him as if he were a child.</p>

<p>But suddenly overcome with shame and
a kind of despair, he moaned:</p>

<p>“Madame Baugan, don’t be cross with
me. I wasn’t like that in civil life.”</p>

<p>Mme. Baugan began to laugh, and Revaud
without more ado laughed too, for
all the lines of his face and his whole soul
were made for laughing, and he loved to
laugh even in the midst of the most acute
pain.</p>

<p>This reply having pleased him, he trotted
it out often, and, when confessing to his
little infirmity, he used to tell everyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
“I wasn’t like that, you know, before I
joined up.”</p>

<p>One morning, in making Mery’s bed,
Mme. Baugan startled the room with an
exclamation. The paralytic lad had not
been able to restrain himself.</p>

<p>“What! Mery! You, too, my poor
friend!”</p>

<p>Mery, once a handsome country lad with
a splendid body, looked at his dead limbs
and sighed:</p>

<p>“It is quite possible, Madame. I can’t
feel what’s going on.”</p>

<p>But Revaud was delighted. All the
morning he cried, “It isn’t only me! It
isn’t only me!” And no one grudged him
his joy, for when you are in the depths of
despair you are glad to have companions in
your misery.</p>

<p>The most happy phrases have only a
short-lived success. Revaud, who had a
sense of humour, soon felt the moment
coming when he would no longer find comfort
in the remark that “he wasn’t like that
before he joined up.” It was then he received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
a letter from his father. It came unexpectedly
one morning. Revaud’s face had
just been washed, and his great Gallic
moustache had been cut&mdash;from caprice&mdash;according
to the American pattern. All the
hospital filed past at the corner of the door
in order to see Revaud who looked like a
very sick “English gentleman.”</p>

<p>He turned the letter over with his fingers
that were deformed by misery and toil; then
he said uneasily, “What does the letter
mean? Do they still want to kick up a
row?”</p>

<p>Revaud was a married man; but during
the six months in which he had remained
without news from his wife he had got used
to his loneliness. He was in his room, behind
the door, and sought no quarrels with anyone.
Then why had a letter been sent to him?</p>

<p>“It must be they want to make a row,”
he repeated; and he handed the letter to
Mme. Baugan, for her to read.</p>

<p>The letter came from Revaud’s father.
In ten lines written in a painstaking hand,
with thick downstrokes and fine upstrokes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
with flourishes and a dashing signature, the
old man announced that he was going to
visit him one day in the near future.</p>

<p>Laughter came back again to Revaud,
and with laughter a final justification for
living. All day he toyed with the letter, and
used gladly to show it and say:</p>

<p>“We are going to have a visit. My father
is coming to see us.”</p>

<p>Then he began to be rather confiding.</p>

<p>“My father, you know, is a fine fellow, but
he has had some hard knocks. You will see
my father&mdash;he’s a fellow that’s up to a few
tricks, and, what’s worse, he wears a shirt
collar.”</p>

<p>Finally he ended by restricting his comments
on his father’s character to this
statement:</p>

<p>“My father!&mdash;you’ll see&mdash;he wears a shirt
collar.”</p>

<p>The days passed, and Revaud spoke so
often of his father that in the end he no
longer knew whether the visitor had come
or was yet to come. Thus, by a special providence,
Revaud never knew that his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
did not come to see him; and afterwards,
when wanting to make allusion to this remarkable
period, he had recourse to a very
ample phrase, and used to say:</p>

<p>“It was the time of my father’s visit.”</p>

<p>Revaud was spoiled: he never lacked
cigarettes or company, and he used to confess
so contentedly: “I’m the pet of this
hospital.”</p>

<p>Besides, Revaud was not difficult. Tarrissant
had only to appear between his
crutches for the dying man to exclaim,
“Here’s another who’s come to see me. I
told you I was the pet here.”</p>

<p>Tarrissant had undergone the same operation
as Revaud. It was a complicated
business, taking place in the knee. Only,
in the case of Tarrissant the operation had
been more or less a complete success, and
in the case of Revaud, more or less a
failure, because “it depends on one’s blood.”</p>

<p>From the operation itself Revaud thought
he had learned a new word: “His knee had
been ‘dezected.’” He used to look at
Tarrissant, and, comparing himself with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
convalescing young man, he came to the
simple conclusion:</p>

<p>“We are both ‘dezected’ men, except
that my old woman has left me; and, too, I
have been overworked.”</p>

<p>It was the only allusion that Revaud
ever made to his conjugal misfortune and
to his toiling past.</p>

<p>But really, why think of all these things?
Hasn’t man enough to do with a troublesome
leg, or this perpetual need which he
cannot control?</p>

<p>Every evening each one prepared to
face the long night with little preparations,
as if they were about to set out on a journey.
Remusot was pricked in the thigh, and at
once he was in a dreamland bathed in
sweat, in which the fever brought before his
eyes things he never would describe to anyone.
Mery had a large mug of some decoction
or other prepared for him, and he had only
to stretch out his arm to get it. Sandrap
smoked his last cigarette, and Revaud asked
for his cushion. It was a little cotton pillow,
which was placed against his side. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
when this was done was Revaud willing to
say, “That’s it, boys! That’ll do.”</p>

<p>And from that moment they went off
into a sleep that was horrible and teeming
like a forest waylaid with snares, and each
of them wandered in the pursuit of his
dreams.</p>

<p>While the mind was beating its wings,
the four bodies remained still. A little
night-light relieved the darkness. Then, in
slippered footfalls, a night attendant came
and put his head through the door and
heard the four tortured respiratory movements,
and occasionally surprised the open
but absent look of Remusot; in contemplating
these patched-up human remains,
he suddenly thought of a raft of shipwrecked
men&mdash;of a raft tossed by the waves of the
sea, with four bodies in distress.</p>

<p>The window-panes continued to vibrate
plaintively with the echoes of the war.
Sometimes, in the course of the long night,
the war seemed to stop, as a woodcutter
pauses to take breath between two blows
of his axe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>It was then that, in the deep and sudden
silence, they awoke with queer painful
sensations; and they thought of all the
things that happen in battle&mdash;they thought
of these things when not a sound could be
heard.</p>

<p>Dawn broke reluctantly, those days of
winter. The orderlies scrubbed the floor.
They blew out the spluttering night-light
which stank of burnt fat. Then there were
the morning ablutions, and all the pains
and screams of wound-dressing.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the middle of the trivial
duties of the day, the door was solemnly
opened and a general entered, followed by
the officers of the staff. He paused at
first on the threshold, overcome by the
unwholesome air, then he made a few steps
into the room and asked who were these
men. The doctor used to whisper in his
ear, and the general replied quite simply:</p>

<p>“Ah, good! Excellent!”</p>

<p>When he had gone, Revaud always used
to assure us:</p>

<p>“The general wouldn’t think of coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
here without seeing me. He’s an old
pal.”</p>

<p>After that, there was something to talk
about the whole day.</p>

<p>Many officers used to come as well&mdash;of
the highest rank. They read the papers
pinned on the wall. “Frankly,” they said,
“it’s a very fine result.”</p>

<p>One of them began one day to examine
Mery. He was a doctor, with a white-bearded
chin, very large and corpulent, his breast
decorated with crosses and his neck pink
with good living. He seemed a decent fellow
and disposed to show sympathy. He said,
in fact:</p>

<p>“Poor devil! Ah, but you see the same
sort of thing might happen to me.”</p>

<p>More often than not, nobody came,
absolutely no one, and the day was endured
only by being taken in small mouthfuls, like
their meat at dinner.</p>

<p>Once a great event happened. Mery
was taken out and placed under the X-rays.
He came back, well content, remarking:</p>

<p>“At least, it isn’t painful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Another time Revaud’s leg was amputated.
He had murmured when giving his
consent: “I’d done my best to keep it,
this old leg of mine! Well! well! So
much the worse, so get on with it. Poor
old thing!”</p>

<p>He burst out laughing once again; and
no one has laughed, and no one will laugh
again, as Revaud did that day.</p>

<p>His leg then was to be amputated. The
noblest blood in France flowed once more.
But it took place between four walls, in a
little room white-washed like a dairy, and
no one heard of it.</p>

<p>Revaud was put back to bed behind the
door. He awoke, and like a child said:</p>

<p>“They’ve set me back quite warm and
‘comfy’ with this leg.”</p>

<p>Revaud had rather a good night, and
when, on the next day, Mme. Baugan came
into the room, he said to her, as he now
was in the habit of saying:</p>

<p>“Fine, Madame Baugan. I’ve had a
good night.”</p>

<p>With this, his head dropped on one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
side, his mouth opened little by little, and,
without further remark or movement, he
was dead.</p>

<p>“Poor Revaud!” exclaimed Mme. Baugan.
“Oh! he is dead.”</p>

<p>She kissed his brow, and at once began
to lay him out, for a long day faced her
and she could not afford to waste time.</p>

<p>As Mme. Baugan dressed Revaud, she
grumbled and scolded good-naturedly because
the corpse was difficult to manage.</p>

<p>Sandrap, Mery and Remusot said nothing.
The rain streamed down the panes, which
never stopped rattling because of the gunfire.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">ON THE SOMME FRONT</h2>
</div>


<p>I hadn’t the heart to laugh, but sometimes
I felt vaguely envious. I thought
of the men who were carrying on the war,
in the newspapers&mdash;those who wrote: “The
line has been pierced; why hesitate to throw
in fifty divisions?” Or: “we have only to
bring our reserves right up to the line. A
hundred thousand men must at once fill the
gap.”</p>

<p>I longed to see that brave set compelled
to find between Fouilly and Maricourt a little
corner as secure as their little heaps of paper
plans, on which a purring cat might find
repose. I swear they would have found it
rather difficult.</p>

<p>I thought abstractedly about my work as
I went along; from time to time I glanced
round at the scene, and I assure you one
hit upon some queer things.</p>

<p>Beneath the rows of poplar trees that
stretched along the valley a huge army had
taken cover, with its battalions, its animals
and wagons, its iron and steel, its faded
tarpaulins and leather trappings that stank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and its refuse heaps. Horses nibbled at
the bark of large decaying trees, that were
stricken with a premature autumnal disease.
Three meagre elm trees served as a shelter
for a whole encampment: a dusty hedge threw
its protecting shadow over the ammunition
train of a regiment. But the vegetation
was scarce and the shelter it afforded most
scanty, so that from all parts the army overflowed
right on to the bare plain, tearing up
the surface of the roads and leaving a regular
network of tracks, as if great hordes of wild
beasts had made their passage along it.</p>

<p>There were roads that marked off the
British from the French. There you could
see marching by the splendid artillery of
the British, quite new and glistening, fitted
with light-coloured harness and nickel-plated
buckles, with special rugs for the horses,
that were well fed and gleaming like circus
mounts.</p>

<p>The infantry were also filing past&mdash;young
men, all of them. They marched to the wild
negro music of the flutes and gaily-coloured
drums. Then cars fitted with beds, tier upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
tier, came slowly along, jolting as little as
possible, carrying the wounded fair-haired
boys with wondering eyes, looking as placid
as a touring party of Cook’s.</p>

<p>Our villages were packed to suffocation.
Man had got everywhere, like a plague or a
flood.</p>

<p>He had driven the cattle from their
shelter and fixed his abode in hutches, stables
and cowsheds.</p>

<p>The shell depôts seemed like pottery
fields full of earthenware pitchers. Barges
floated on the slimy water of the canal.
Some carried food and guns: others served
as hospital-boats.</p>

<p>From the movements of this heaving
mass of beings and the creaking of their
machinery, the panting of a giant seemed to
issue forth and fill the silence. The whole
scene suggested a sinister fair, a festival of
war, a gathering of Bohemian clans and
dancers of evil repute.</p>

<p>The nearer you got to Bray the more
congested the country appeared to be. The
motor-riding population held tyrannic sway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
over the roads, forcing the lowlier horse-wagons
to drive across the fields. Little
trollies running on rails clanked along pompously,
showing great independence, hugging
the ground with their small wheels, and their
back loaded with millions of cartridges: in
amongst the boxes some fellows were squatting,
half asleep, proclaiming to the world in
general the pleasure of being seated on something
which does all the walking for you.</p>

<p>When I got above Chipilly, I beheld
an extraordinary scene. An immense plain
undulated there, covered with so many men,
things and beasts, that over vast stretches
the ground was no longer visible. Beyond
the ruined tower which looks upon Etinehem
lay land of a reddish-brown colour. I saw
later that this colour was due to a great
mass of horses closely pressed against each
other. Every day they were brought to
the muddy trough of the Somme to slake
their thirst. The tracks were turned into
sloughs, and the air was filled with an overpowering
smell of sweat and manure.</p>

<p>Then, towards the left, stood a veritable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
town of unbleached tents, whose top coverings
were marked with large red crosses.
Farther on, the ground sank down, only to
curve up again suddenly towards the battlefield
quivering on the horizon in a black
fog. From different points a burst of discharging
shells sent up white clouds, side
by side, in quick succession, like rows of
trees on the roadside. In the open sky
more than thirty balloons formed a ring,
giving one the impression of spectators
interested in a brawl.</p>

<p>The Adjutant, pointing out the tents,
said to me, “That’s Hill 80. You will see
more wounded passing there than there are
hairs on your head, and more blood flowing
than the water in the canal. All those who
are hit between Combles and Bouchavesnes
are brought to Hill 80.”</p>

<p>I nodded, and we relapsed again into
silence and reflection. The day gave out
in the unclean air of the marshes. The
English were firing their big cannon not
far from us, and their roar crashed along
the alignment like an enraged horse dashing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
blindly away. The horizon was so thick
with guns that you could hear a continuous
gurgle as of a huge cauldron in the tormenting
grip of a furnace.</p>

<p>The Adjutant turned again to me.
“Three of your brothers have been killed,”
he said. “In one sense you are out of the
business. You won’t be very badly off as
a stretcher-bearer. In another it is unfortunate,
but a good thing for you. It’s
hard work, stretcher-bearing, but it’s better
than the line. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>I said nothing. I thought of that
devastated little valley where I had spent
the first few weeks of the summer in front
of the Plémont hill&mdash;the deadly hours I
spent looking at the ruins of Lassigny
between the torn and jagged poplars, and
the apple-trees blighted with the horror on
the edge of the chaotic road, and the repulsive
shell-holes full of green slime and swarming
with life, and the mute face of the Château
de Plessier, and the commanding hill which
a cosmic upheaval alone had made capable
of giving rise to grim forebodings. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
during long nights I had breathed the fetid
air of the corpse-laden fields. In the most
despairing loneliness I had been in turn
terrified of death and longing for it. And
then some one came along one day to tell
me that “You can go back behind the
lines. Your third brother has been killed.”
And many of the men looked at me, seeming
to think with the Adjutant, “Your
third brother is dead. In a sense you
are lucky.”</p>

<p>Those were my thoughts as I entered
upon my new duties. We were walking
along the plateau, which stood out before
heaven, erect as an altar, piled with millions
of creatures ready for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>It had been dry for several days, and we
lived under the rule of King Dust. The dust
is the price we pay for fine weather: it
attacks the fighting pack, intrudes upon its
work, its food and its thoughts; it makes
your lips filthy, your teeth crunch, and your
eyes inflamed. But when it disappears the
reign of mud begins, and then we passionately
desire to stagnate again in the dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Far away, like idly moving rivers, large
columns of dust marked all the roads in the
district, and were filtered by the wind as
they flowed over the countryside. The light
of day was polluted with it, as the sky was
ravaged by great flights of aeroplanes, and
the silence violated and degraded, and the
earth with its vegetation torn and mutilated.</p>

<p>I was not that day by any means disposed
to be happy, but all this plunged me into
the deepest gloom.</p>

<p>Looking all around me I found the only
places where I could rest my eyes were in the
innocent looks of the horses or on some
unfortunate timid men who worked on the
roadside. Everything else was nothing but
a bristling gesture of war.</p>

<p>Night had fallen when we arrived at the
city of tents. The Adjutant took me to a tent
and found me a place on some straw which
was strongly reminiscent of the pigsty. I
took off my knapsack, lay down and fell
asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I got up with the dawn and, wandering
through the mist, tried to find my bearings.</p>

<p>There was the road leading from Albert&mdash;worn,
hollowed, and terribly overrun. It
bore the never-ending stream of wounded.
Alongside of it stood the city of tents, with its
streets, its suburbs, and its public squares.
Behind the tents, a cemetery. That was all.</p>

<p>I was leaning on a fence and I looked at
the cemetery. Though it was overflowing,
its appetite was insatiable. A group of
German prisoners were occupied in digging
long dark pits that were like so many open
and expectant mouths. Two officers went
by: one was fat, and looked as if at any
moment he would be struck with apoplexy.
He was gesticulating wildly to the other.
“We have,” he said, “got ready in advance
200 graves and almost as many coffins. No,
you can’t say that this offensive has not
been planned.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, a large number of
coffins had been already completed. They
filled the tent where the corpses were to be unceremoniously
laid out. Outside in the open,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
a large gang of joiners were engaged in cutting
up planks of pinewood. They were whistling
and singing innocently, as is usual with those
who work with their hands.</p>

<p>I realised once again how a man’s opinion
of great events is determined by his vocation
and aptitudes. There was a sergeant there
whose views of Armageddon varied with the
quality of the wood which he had to use.
When the wood was bad he used to say,
“This war is damned rot.” But when the
wood was clear of knots his view was:
“We’ll get them licked.”</p>

<p>The heavy and responsible task of running
the hospital was entrusted to a nervy and
excitable young man. He appeared at every
moment, his fingers clutching bundles of
papers, which he passed from one hand to the
other. I had few opportunities of hearing
him speak, but, when I did, each time I caught
the same words: “That’s not my business&mdash;I
am getting crazy with it all. I have enough
worries of that sort.”</p>

<p>I knew then that he had to think of
many things. Almost all day a procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
of motor cars, heavily laden with a groaning
mass of wounded, came along the winding
road which was being hastily metalled, looking
like the ravenous gullet of this vast organism.
On the top of the bend the lorries were
unloaded under a porch decorated with
flags, bearing no small resemblance to the
festooned arch which on wedding days is
erected at church doors.</p>

<p>From the first day I was ordered on
night duty to deal with the ambulance cars
as they arrived. A dozen of us were grouped
under the porch for this purpose.</p>

<p>Up to that time it was only in the trenches
that I had seen my comrades, wounded
beside me, starting out on a long and
mysterious journey of which little was
known to us. The man who was hit
appeared to be spirited away&mdash;he vanished
from the battlefield. I was going to know
all the stages of the suffering existence he
was then only beginning.</p>

<p>The night I went on duty there had been
a scrap towards Maurepas or Le Forest.
Happening between two days of tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
fighting, it was one of those incidents which
seldom call for a single line in the communiqués.
Yet the wounded streamed in
all night. As soon as they were lowered from
the cars, we got them into a large tent.
It was an immense canvas hall lit with
electricity. It had been pitched on ground
covered with stubble, and its rough soil
was bristling with anæmic grass and badly
pressed clods. Those among the wounded
who could walk were directed along a passage
railed off on both sides, as is done at theatre
entrances to make the crowd line up into
a queue. They seemed dazed and exhausted.
We took away their arms, knives and
grenades. They let you do anything to
them: they were like children overcome
with sleep. The massacre of Europe cannot
proceed without organisation. All the
acts of the play are based on the most
detailed calculation. As these men filed
past, they were counted and labelled; clerks
verified their identity with the unconcerned
accuracy of customs officials. They,
on their part, replied with the patience of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
eternal public at government inquiry offices.
Sometimes they even ventured to make a
remark.</p>

<p>“Your name is Menu,” one cavalryman
was asked. “Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>And the cavalryman replied in a heart-rending
tone:</p>

<p>“Alas! it is, unfortunately.”</p>

<p>I remember a little man whose arm was
in a sling. A doctor was looking at his
papers, and said:</p>

<p>“You have a wound in your right arm?”</p>

<p>And the man replied so modestly:</p>

<p>“Oh! it is not a wound. It is only a
hole!”</p>

<p>In one corner of the tent they were
giving out food and drink. A cook was
carving slices of beef and cutting up a round
of cheese. The wounded seized the food
with their muddy and blood-stained hands;
and they were eating slowly and with evident
relish. The inference was plain. Many were
suffering primarily from hunger and thirst.
They sat timidly on a bench like some very
poor guests at a buffet during a garden party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>In front of them there were a score of
wounded Germans who had been placed
there indiscriminately. They were dozing
or throwing hungry glances on the food and
the pails of steaming tea. Hitting on a
popular slang expression, a grey-haired
infantryman, who was munching large pieces
of boiled beef, said suddenly to the cook:</p>

<p>“Hang it all! Why not give them a
piece of bully-beef?”</p>

<p>“Do you know them then?” said the
cook jocularly.</p>

<p>“Do I know them! The poor devils!
We have been punching each other the
whole blessed day. Chuck them a piece
of meat. Why not?”</p>

<p>A frivolous young man, short-sighted,
with a turned-up nose, added in a tense voice:</p>

<p>“Ought to be done, you know&mdash;our
honour....”</p>

<p>And they went on gravely chatting and
gulped down cupfuls of a hot brew which
was poured from a metal jug. From another
angle in the tent the scene was very different.
The men were lying down: they had grave
wounds. Placed side by side on the uneven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
ground, they made a mosaic of pain stained
with mud and blood, the colours of war;
reeking with sweat and corruption, the smells
of war; noisy with cries, moans and hiccups
which are the sounds and music of war.</p>

<p>I shivered at the sight. I had known
the bristling horror of the massacre and the
charge. I was to learn another horror, that
of the <em>tableau</em>&mdash;the accumulation of prostrate
victims, the spectacle of the vast hall
swarming with human larvæ, in heaps, on the
floor.</p>

<p>I had finished my work with the stretcher
and hastened to make my round of the
wounded. I was so deeply moved that I
was rather hindered in my work. Some of
the men were vomiting, suffering unutterable
agony, and their brows streaming with perspiration.
Others were very quiet and could
be more or less rational: they seemed to be
following the internal progress of their illness.
I was completely upset by one of them. He
was a fair-haired sergeant with a slight
moustache. His face was buried in his hands
and he was sobbing with despair and what
seemed like shame. I asked him if he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
suffering pain. He scarcely replied. Then,
gently lifting his blanket, I saw that he had
been terribly hit by grape shot in his virility.
And I felt a deep pity for his youth and his
tears.</p>

<p>There was also a boy who used to utter
a queer plaint, current in his locality. But
I could only catch these syllables: “Ah!
mon ... don....” A doctor who was passing
said to him:</p>

<p>“Come, come! a little patience! Do not
cry out like that.”</p>

<p>The child paused a moment before replying:
“I’d have to lose my voice first if I’m
not to cry.”</p>

<p>His neighbour was a big, rough, good-natured
fellow with a powerful jaw, strong
and massive features, with the peculiar shape
of the skull and growth of hair that characterise
the folk of Auvergne.</p>

<p>He looked at the boy who was groaning
at his side, and, turning to me, commented,
with a shrug of the shoulders:</p>

<p>“Rotten luck being hit like that, poor
child!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“And what’s the matter with you?” I
said to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think I have lost my feet;
but I am fairly strong and my body is
solid.”...</p>

<p>It was true! I saw that both his feet had
been torn away.</p>

<p>Round the electric arcs, luminous rings
were formed by the sickening vapour. On
the sides of the tent, in the folds, you could
see the flies sleeping in big black patches,
overcome by the cold freshness of night.</p>

<p>Large waves rolled on the canvas, passing
like a shudder or violently flapping, according
as the wind or gunfire was the cause.</p>

<p>I stepped carefully over some stretchers
and found myself outside, in a night that
roared, illuminated by the aurora borealis of
the battlefield.</p>

<p>I had walked, with my hands held out in
front of me, until I came upon a fence.
Suddenly I knew what it was to be leaning
against the parapet of hell!</p>

<p>What a human tempest! What explosions
of hatred and destruction! You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
would have said that a company of giants
were forging the horizon of the earth with
repeated blows that filled the air with countless
sparks. Innumerable furtive lights gave
one continuous great light that lived, throbbed
and danced, dazzling the sky and the land.
Jets of iridescent light were bursting in the
open sky as if they fell from the blows of the
steam-hammer on white-hot steel. To me
who had only recently left the trenches, each
of these firework displays meant something&mdash;advice,
commands, desperate calls, signals
for slaughter; and I interpreted this furnace
as if it had expressed in words the fury and
distress of the combatants.</p>

<p>Towards Combles, on the left of Maurepas,
one section above all seemed to be raging.
It was just there that the junction was
made between the English and the French
armies; and it was there that the enemy
concentrated a tumultuous and never-slackening
fire. Every night, during many
weeks, I saw this place lighted up with the
same devouring flame. It was at each instant
so intense that every instant appeared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
be the decisive one. But hours, nights and
months went slowly by in the eternity of
time, and each of these terrible moments
was only one intense outburst out of an
infinity of them. Thus often the agony
of wounds is such that you would hardly
think it could be endured any longer. But
death comes not willingly at the desire of
men: it strikes at will, when it likes, where
it likes, and hardly permits itself to be
directed or coaxed.</p>

<p>Morning came. Those who have seen
the daybreaks of the war, after nights spent
in fighting, or in the bloody work of the
ambulance, will understand what is the most
ugly and mournful thing in the world.</p>

<p>For my part, I shall never forget the
green and grudging light of the dawn, the
desolating look of the lamps and the faces,
the asphyxiating smell of men attacked by
corruption, the cold shiver of the morning,
like the last frozen breath of night in the
congealed foliage of large trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My work as a stretcher-bearer was over.
I could return to carpentry. I made heavy
planks of green wood and thought of all sorts
of things, as the mind does when robbed of
sleep and overwhelmed with bitterness.</p>

<p>Towards eight o’clock in the morning
the sun was hailed by a race of flies as
it was emerging painfully from the mist;
and these animals began to abandon themselves
to their vast daily orgy.</p>

<p>All those who were on the Somme in
1916 will never forget the flies. The chaos
of the battlefield, its wealth in carrion, the
abnormal accumulation of animals, of men,
of food that had gone bad&mdash;all these were
factors in determining that year a gigantic
swarm of flies. They seemed to have
gathered there from all parts of the globe
to attend a solemn function. Every possible
kind of fly was there, and the human world,
victim of its own hatreds, remained defenceless
against this horrible invasion. During
a whole summer they were the absolute
monarchs and queens, and we did not dispute
the food with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>I have seen, on Ridge 80, wounds swarming
with larvæ&mdash;sights which, since the battle
of the Marne, we had been able to forget.
I have seen flies dashing themselves on
the blood and the pus of wounds and feeding
themselves with such drunken frenzy that,
before they could be induced to leave their
feasting and fly away, they had to be seized
with pincers or with one’s fingers. The
army suffered cruelly from them, and it is
amazing that, in the end, victory was not
theirs.</p>

<p>Nothing had a more lugubrious and
stripped appearance than the plateau on
which stood the city of tents. Every morning
heavy traction engines went up the
Etinehem hill and brought water to the
camp. Several casks placed in amongst
the trees were filled with water of rather a
sweet taste, and this provision was to suffice,
for a whole day, to slake the thirst of the
men and clean away the impurities and
emissions of disease.</p>

<p>Except on the horizon line, not a bush
was to be seen. Nowhere a tuft of fresh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
grass. Nothing but an immense stretch of
dust or mud, according as the face of the
sky was calm or stormy. To relieve this
desolate scene with a little colour, someone
had had the happy idea of cultivating a
little garden between the tents. And the
wounded, on being lowered from the cars,
were astonished to see, in the midst of the
ghastliness of military activity, the pale
smile of a geranium, or juniper trees uprooted
from the stony ridges of the valley and
replanted hastily in the style of French
gardens.</p>

<p>I cannot, without being strangely moved,
recall the tent in which about twelve soldiers
were dying of gaseous gangrene. Around
this deathly spot ran a thin little border of
flowers, and an assiduous fellow was calmly
trying to bring into bloom crimson bell-flowers.</p>

<p>Sometimes the earth, torrid with the
month of August, seemed to reel with the
satiating deluge of a storm. At such moments
the tents used to crackle furiously and
seemed, like great livid birds, to cling to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the earth in order better to resist the blast
of the south wind.</p>

<p>But neither the gusts of rain nor the
galloping thunderclaps, none of these tumults
of Nature, interrupted man from his war.
The operations and the dressing of wounds
continued on Hill 80 as, on neighbouring
hills, the batteries ploughed up the disputed
ground. Often it seemed that man insisted
on speaking more loudly than Heaven, and
the guns and the thunder seemed determined
to outbid each other.</p>

<p>Once, I remember, the thunder had the
last word: two sausage-shaped balloons took
fire, and the artillery, stricken blind, stammered
and then became mute.</p>

<p>In a few days, I was given the job
of furnishing the tents with little pieces of
joinery, benches and tables. I worked on
the spot, taking my tools with me, and I
did my best not to disturb the patients,
who were already exhausted by the din of
battle. This was very painful work, because
it made me a helpless spectator of unutterable
misery. I remember being greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
touched on one occasion: a young artilleryman,
wounded in the face, was being visited
by his brother, a cadet in a neighbouring
regiment. The latter, very pale, was looking
at the face of the wounded man, of which
only an eye could be seen and a stained
bandage. He took his hands, and bent
down quite naturally to kiss him; then he
shrank back, only to come near again, victim
of an emotion of mingled horror and pity.
Then the wounded man, who could not speak,
had an inspiration that was full of tenderness:
with outspread fingers he began to
stroke the hair and face of his brother. This
silent affection told how willingly the soul
gives up the spoken word and yields to its
most intimate gestures.</p>

<p>In the same tent Lieutenant Gambin
was dying.</p>

<p>He was rather a crude, simple-hearted
man, who had been engaged in some obscure
civilian employment, and who now, solely
by dint of his stubborn courage, had gained
a commission. His large frame lay exhausted
from hæmorrhage, and for two days he lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
dying. The breath of life took two days
to quit his ice-cold limbs, from which exuded
large beads of glutinous sweat. From time
to time he sighed. At last, leaving my
screw-driver and iron nails, I asked him if
he would like something. He looked at
me with wide-open eyes, full of memories
and sadness, and said:</p>

<p>“No, thank you. But oh, I’ve got the
hump!”</p>

<p>I was almost glad to see him die: he was
too conscious of his long, dragging, terrible
death.</p>

<p>Little Lalau who died the same day was
at least unconscious, though delirious, to
the last.</p>

<p>He was a country lad, and had been
struck in the spinal cord by a piece of shell.
A kind of meningitis ensued, and, at once,
he lost his reason. The pupils of his eyes
swung to and fro with sickening rapidity;
he never ceased moving his jaw, apparently
chewing like a ruminant. One day I found
him devouring a string of beads which had
been hung round his neck by a chaplain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
An orderly kept his mouth open while we
removed several pieces of wood and steel.
The poor wretch laughed softly, repeating:
“It’s a bit hard. It’s a bit hard to chew”;
and the lines of his face twitched with innumerable
spasms of pain.</p>

<p>Delirium upsets and wounds the spirit.
For it constitutes the uttermost disorder&mdash;that
of the mind. But it perhaps betrays
benevolence on the part of Nature when it
deprives man of the consciousness of his
misery. Life and death have it in their
power to confer these mournful blessings.
Once I saw a soldier struck in so many places
that the doctors decided he was beyond the
resources of their skill. Among other wounds
there was a long splinter of steel driven like
a dagger through his right wrist. The sight
was so cruel and revolting that an attempt
was made to remove the steel. A doctor
gripped it firmly and tried to loosen it with
sharp, short pulls.</p>

<p>“Is it giving you pain?” he said from time
to time.</p>

<p>And the patient replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“No; but I’m thirsty!”</p>

<p>“How is it,” I asked the doctor, “that he
can’t feel the pain you are giving him?”</p>

<p>“It’s because he is in a state of shock,”
replied the surgeon.</p>

<p>And I understood how the very extremity
of pain sometimes obtains for its victims a
truce which is, in a way, a foretaste of the
sweets of death&mdash;the prelude to extinction.</p>

<p>At each end of the large marquees one
of those small bell tents had been erected to
which the soldiers had given the name of
“mosques.” They served as death chambers.
There were placed the men who were lost to
human succour, in a loneliness that presaged
the tomb. And some of them were aware of
this. There was a soldier with a riddled
abdomen who asked, on entering the tent,
to be dressed in clean linen.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me die,” he pleaded, “in an
unclean shirt. Give me something white.
If you are too busy, I’ll put it on myself.”</p>

<p>Sometimes, unutterably wearied by so
much suffering, I asked for work outside the
camp, in order to sort out my ideas and renew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the theme of my reflections. It was always
with a sigh of comfort that I got away from
the city of tents. I contemplated, from a
distance, this sinister agglomeration, which
certainly bore comparison with an itinerant
fair. I tried to distinguish amid the white
canvas and red crosses the tops of these
little “mosques.” I gazed also at the cemetery
where hundreds and hundreds of bodies
had been buried; and, realising the sum of
the misery, despair and rage accumulated
on that spot of the earth, I thought of the
people who, far away in the heart of France,
were crowding the concert cafés, the drawing-rooms,
the cinemas, the brothels, finding
brazen enjoyment in themselves, in the
world, in the weather; and, sheltered by
this quivering rampart of the sacrificed,
will not share in this universal anguish.
I thought of these people with more shame
than resentment.</p>

<p>The excursions in the open freshened me
a little, and I found some comfort in the sight
of healthy men spared by the battle.</p>

<p>Sometimes I went as far as the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
sector. Masses of long-range artillery were
to be seen there. The guns were served by
soldiers in shirt-sleeves and long trousers
stained by oil and cart-grease. They looked
more like factory workers than soldiers. You
felt then how war has become an industry&mdash;an
engineering business devoted to mechanical
slaughter and massacre.</p>

<p>One night, walking along the Albert road,
I overheard the conversation of some men
who were sitting on the upturned earth of
a pit. By their accent they were peasants
from the north and must have belonged
to the regiments which had just been
under fire.</p>

<p>“After the war,” said one of them,
“those who are going to dabble in politics,
they’ll have to say they had a hand in this
confounded war.”</p>

<p>But this frank opinion, caught in passing
one night along a road in the front&mdash;this
inconsequent, unanswered comment was lost
in the tumult of the gunfire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I gained much by being stretcher-bearer.
I came to know the men better than I
had ever done until then&mdash;to know them
bathed in a purer light, <em>naked</em> before death,
stripped even of the instincts which disfigure
the divine beauty of simple souls.</p>

<p>In the midst of the greatest trials our
race of peasants has remained vigorous,
pure, worthy of the noblest human traditions.
I have known them&mdash;Rebic, Louba, Ratier,
Freyssinet, Calmel, Touche, and so many
others whom I must not name if I am not
to mention the whole country. It cannot
be said that pain chose its victims, and yet,
when I used to pass by their beds where
their destiny struggled&mdash;when I looked at
their faces, each one of them, they all seemed
to me good, patient, energetic men, and all
of them deserved to be loved.</p>

<p>Did Rebic, that grey-haired sergeant, not
richly deserve that a loving family waited
longingly for him at home? One day we
came to dress the big gash in his side, and
we hastened to bring him white linen and
made him a warm bed; he began to weep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
good and simple man, and we asked him
why, and he made this sublime answer:</p>

<p>“I cry because of the agony and misery
I am giving you.”</p>

<p>As for Louba, we could not expect to
hear him speak: a shell had smashed in
his face. There remained nothing of it
except one immense cruel gash; an eye
displaced, twisted; and forehead&mdash;a humble
peasant forehead. Yet one day, as we
whispered some brotherly words, Louba
wished to show how pleased he was, and
he smiled to us. They will remember,
those who saw the soul of Louba smiling
faceless.</p>

<p>Freyssinet, child of twenty, often lapsed
into delirium, and was aware of it in his
conscious moments, and asked pardon of
those whom it might have disturbed. The
hour came when he sank into the peace
everlasting. A much-decorated personage
was making the round of the wards attended
by an imposing suite. He stopped at the
foot of each bed and uttered, in a fitting
voice, words conferring whatever honour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
which they represented in the minds of the
patients. He stopped before Freyssinet’s bed
and began his speech. As he was an important
and methodical man, he said what he
had to say without noticing the many signs
that were being made to make him desist.
Having spoken, he nevertheless asked those
who were looking on:</p>

<p>“You wanted to tell me something?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied someone; “it is that the
man is dead.”</p>

<p>But Freyssinet was so modest, so timid,
that the very attitude of his corpse betrayed
respect and confusion.</p>

<p>It is there, also, that I made the
acquaintance of Touche.</p>

<p>He came to us, poor Touche! his head
broken, having had to leave a temporary
hospital owing to its catching fire. I saw
him turning out with his groping hands a
bag which contained all his possessions.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he was saying, “they are
all lost, and I’ll never find them.”</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I am looking for the little photos of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
my two boys and of my wife. Unfortunately,
they are lost. I shall miss them.”</p>

<p>I helped him in his search, and then I
saw that Touche was blind.</p>

<p>Poor Touche! He easily recognised me
by my voice and always had a smile for
me. He was awkward at table, as a man
would naturally be who is not yet accustomed
to his infirmity. But he tried to manage
by himself, and used to tell us in a quiet
voice:</p>

<p>“I am doing my best, you see: I scrape
my plate until I feel there is nothing
more.”</p>

<p>Could I forget the name of the man
who was brought in, one night, with his
two legs smashed, and who murmured
simply:</p>

<p>“It’s hard to have to die! But come!
I’ll be brave.”</p>

<p>But Calmel, Calmel! No one who knew
him will ever wish to forget him. Never
did a man more passionately desire to live!
Never did a man attain greater nobility by
his endurance and resignation! He suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
mortal wounds which at every moment the
light of the life within him repudiated. It
was he who, during a night bombardment,
addressed his hospital comrades, exhorting
them to be calm, with his authoritative
moribund voice.</p>

<p>“Come, come!” he used to say; “we are
all men here, are we not?”</p>

<p>Such is the strength of the spirit that
these words alone, uttered by such a man,
were capable of restoring order and confidence
in the hearts of everyone.</p>

<p>It was to Calmel that a plump civilian,
entrusted with some business or other with
the armies, said one day with jubilant
conviction:</p>

<p>“You appear to be badly hit, my brave
man. But if you knew what wounds we
inflict on them, with our 75! Terrible
wounds, old boy, terrible!”</p>

<p>Each day brought visitors to Hill 80.
They came from Amiens in sumptuous
motor cars. They chatted as they traversed
the great canvas hall, as if at a prize
exhibition of agricultural produce: to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
wounded they addressed a few words that
were in keeping with their personal station,
their opinions and dignity. They wrote notes
on memorandum-books and sometimes
accepted invitations to supper from the
officers. There were foreigners, philanthropists,
politicians, actresses, millionaires,
novelists, and “penny-a-liners.” Those who
were looking for strange sensations were
sometimes admitted to the “mosque” or the
operation-room.</p>

<p>They went away, well content with their
day when the weather was fine, in the sure
knowledge that they had seen some queer
things, heroic fighters, and a model establishment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But silence! I have pronounced their
names&mdash;Freyssinet, Touche, Calmel&mdash;and the
memories which they leave in my heart are
too noble to be mingled with bitterness.</p>

<p>What has become of Hill 80 deserted?
The battle has advanced towards the east.
Winter has come; the city of tents has furled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
its canvas, as a fleet of sailing ships which
must prepare for new destinies.</p>

<p>Often, in imagination, I see again the
bare plateau and the immense burial ground
left derelict in the fields and the mists, like
the wreckage of innumerable ships down in
the depths of the sea.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">RÉCHOUSSAT’S CHRISTMAS</h2>
</div>


<p>Réchoussat repeated in a shrill,
strained voice: “I tell you, they’re
not coming after all.”</p>

<p>Corporal Têtard turned a deaf ear to
this. He was sorting out his stock on a
table: lints, oil, rubber gloves reminiscent
of the fencer, probes enclosed in a tube like
vanilla cornets, a basin of enamelled sheet-iron
resembling a big bean, and a bulging vase
with a wide gaping mouth, looking like anything
at all.</p>

<p>Réchoussat affected an air of indifference.
“They needn’t come if they don’t wish to.
Anyway, I don’t care.”</p>

<p>Corporal Têtard shrugged his shoulders.
“But I tell you they will come,” he said.</p>

<p>The wounded man obstinately shook his
head. “Here, old boy! nobody’ll come here.
All those who visit downstairs never come up
here. I’m only telling you. I don’t really
care, you know.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure they will come.”</p>

<p>“Really, I don’t know why I have been
placed here alone in the room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Probably because you must have quiet.”</p>

<p>“Whether they come or not, it’s all one
to me.”</p>

<p>Réchoussat frowned to show his pride,
then he added, sighing:</p>

<p>“You can begin now with your bag of
tricks.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Corporal Têtard was
ready. He had lighted a candle-end and in
one movement drew back the sheets.</p>

<p>Réchoussat’s body was revealed, extraordinarily
thin, but Têtard scarcely noticed it,
and Réchoussat had for three months now
been fairly accustomed to his misery. He
knew quite well that to have a piece of shell
in the back is a serious matter, and that, when
a man’s legs and abdomen are paralysed, he
is not going to recover quickly.</p>

<p>“Feeling better?” asked Têtard in the
course of his operation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied. “Now it’s six o’clock
and they haven’t come. Good thing! I don’t
mind.”</p>

<p>The corporal did not reply; with a weary
expression he rubbed together his rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
gloves. Riveted to the wick, the candle-flame
leaped and struggled, like a wretched
prisoner yearning to escape and fly up alone
in the blackness of the room, and beyond,
higher, higher, in the winter sky, in regions
where the sounds of the war of man are no
longer heard. Both the patient and the
orderly watched the flame in silence, with
wide-open vague eyes. Every second a gun,
far away, snapped at the panes, and each
time the flame of the candle started nervously.</p>

<p>“It takes a long time! You’re not cold?”
asked Têtard.</p>

<p>“The lower part of my body does not
know what cold means.”</p>

<p>“But it will, one day.”</p>

<p>“Of course it will. It’s dead now, but it
must become alive again. I am only twenty-five;
it’s an age when the flesh has plenty
of vigour.”</p>

<p>The corporal felt awkward, shaking his
head. Réchoussat seemed to him worn out;
he had large sores in the places where the
body rested on the bed. He had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
isolated in order that his more fortunate
comrades should be spared the sight of his
slow, dragging death.</p>

<p>A long moment went by. The silence
was so oppressive that for a moment they
felt their small talk quite inadequate.
Then, as if he was continuing a mental
discussion, Réchoussat suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>“And yet, you know, I’m so easily
satisfied. If they came for two minutes
only.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Têtard. “Hush!”</p>

<p>He leaned, listening, towards the door.
Obscure sounds came from the passage.</p>

<p>“Ah, here they are!” said the orderly.</p>

<p>Réchoussat craned his neck. “Bah! No,
I tell you.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a wonderful light, rich in reflections
of gold and crimson&mdash;a strange
fairy light&mdash;filled the passage. The wall in
front stood out; ordinarily as pale as
December woods, now it suddenly exhibited
the splendour of an eastern palace or of a
princess’ gown. In all this light there was
sound of happy voices and of laughter. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
one could be heard singing, yet the light
itself seemed to be singing a magnificent song.
Réchoussat, who could not move, stretched
his neck the more vigorously, and raised his
hands a little above the sheets, as if he
wanted to feel this beautiful sound and
light.</p>

<p>“You see, you see,” said Têtard. “I
told you they would come.”</p>

<p>Then there was a big blaze. Something
stopped before the door: it was a tree&mdash;a
real fir-tree from the forests, planted in a
green box. There were so many Chinese
lanterns and pink candles hanging from its
branches that it looked like an enormous
torch. But there was something grander
to come: the wise and learned kings now
entered. There was Sorri, a Senegalese gunner,
Moussa and Cazin. Wrapped in cloaks from
Adrianople, they wore long white beards made
of cotton wool.</p>

<p>They walked right into Réchoussat’s room.
Sorri carried a little packet tied with ribbon.
Moussa waved aloft two cigars, and Cazin a
bottle of champagne. The three of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
bowed punctiliously, as they had been told,
and Réchoussat found himself suddenly with
a box of chocolates in his right hand, two
cigars in his left, and a glass of foaming
wine on his little table.</p>

<p>“Ah, boys! No, no; you’re joking,
boys.”</p>

<p>Moussa and Cazin laughed. Sorri showed
his teeth.</p>

<p>“Ah! boys,” repeated Réchoussat, “I
don’t smoke, but I’m going to keep the
cigars as a souvenir. Pass me the wine.”</p>

<p>Sorri took the goblet and offered it as
if it were a sacred cup. Réchoussat drank
gently and said:</p>

<p>“It’s some wine! Good stuff!”</p>

<p>There were more than a score of faces at
the door, and they all smiled at the gentle
naïve Réchoussat.</p>

<p>Afterwards, a veritable sunset! The
wonderful tree receded, jolting into the
passage. The venerable kings disappeared,
with their flowing cloaks and their sham
beards. Réchoussat still held the goblet
and gazed at the candle as if all the lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
existed there. He laughed, slowly repeating,
“It’s some wine!” Then he continued
to laugh and never said a word.</p>

<p>Quite gently the darkness entered the
room again, and lodged itself everywhere,
like an intimate animal disturbed in its
habits.</p>

<p>With the darkness, something very sad
insinuated itself everywhere, which was the
odour of Réchoussat’s illness. A murmuring
silence rested on every object, like dust.
The face of the patient ceased to reflect
the splendour of the Christmas tree; his
head sunk down, he looked at the bed, at
his thin ulcerated legs, the glass vessel full of
unclean liquid, the probe, all these incomprehensible
things, and he said, stammering
with astonishment:</p>

<p>“But ... but ... what is the matter
then? What is the matter?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LIEUTENANT DAUCHE</h2>
</div>


<p>It was in the month of October 1915 that
I made the acquaintance of Lieutenant
Dauche.</p>

<p>I can never recall that time without deep
emotion. We had been living, before Sapigneul,
through weeks of fire. The Champagne
offensive had for long been rumbling on our
right, and its farthest eddies seemed to break
on our sector, as the waves scattered by a
hurricane that spends itself in the open sea.
For three days our guns had made reply to
those of Pouilleuse, and we had waited, rifles
at hand, for an order which never came. Our
minds were uneasy and vacant, still reeling
from that kind of resonant drunkenness which
results from a prolonged bombardment. We
were glad at not having to make a murderous
attack, and at the same time we worried over
the causes which had prevented it.</p>

<p>It was then that I was wounded for the
first time. Some chance evacuation took
me to the Château de S&mdash;&mdash;, which is, for
the Rheims country, an indifferent piece of
architecture. It stands in the midst of soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
verdure and looks, across the slope of the hill,
upon the delicate valley of the Vesle.</p>

<p>My wound, though not serious, was painful
enough. It made me a little feverish and
long for silence and solitude. It gave me
pleasure to remain, for long hours, in the
presence of a pain which, while endurable,
made me test my patience and reflect on the
vulnerable nature of an organism in which,
up till then, I had placed an unshakable
confidence.</p>

<p>I occupied a bright room, decorated with
Jouy tapestry and delicate paintings. My
bed was placed there together with that of
another officer, who walked silently up and
down the room, and who respected my
reticence. The day came, however, when I
was told to take solid food, and that day we
began chatting, no doubt because the most
ancient human traditions dispose those who
eat together to enter into conversation.</p>

<p>In spite of the moods which I then experienced,
this talk was a pleasure and gave
me what I must have needed.</p>

<p>I was absorbed in melancholy reflections,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
and brooded over the misery of the times.
Lieutenant Dauche from the first appeared
to me to show a serenity of mind and a quiet
cheerfulness of spirit. Later, I saw that he
deserved to be greatly admired for maintaining
such an attitude in the face of an
unending misfortune which had not spared
him any trials.</p>

<p>We were both natives of Lille; it gave
us a point of contact. The event of an
inheritance, and the requirements of his
position, early led Dauche to settle in the
Meuse district and set up a home there.</p>

<p>His marriage was happy, and his young
wife was mother of two fine children. A
third was about to be born when the German
invasion swept over the face of France,
unsettling the world, ruining a prosperous
industry, violently separating Dauche from
his children and his pregnant wife, of whom,
since, he had only heard uncertain and
disquieting news.</p>

<p>I, too, had left in the invaded country
those I loved, and also my possessions. I
felt, therefore, in the presence of Dauche<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the effect of that solidarity which is aroused
by a common misfortune. I ought, however,
to admit that my comrade had suffered more
terrible calamities than mine with greater
fortitude, though he was more sensitive, as I
observed on several occasions.</p>

<p>Of pleasing height, Dauche had the pink
complexion and the fair hair characteristic
of my country. A delicate beard adorned and
prolonged a face full of gentleness and life,
like those young men whom Flemish artists
have portrayed, often so happily, wearing
a frilled collar and a heavy golden chain
gleaming on a waistcoat of dark velvet.</p>

<p>A light bandage passed over his forehead.
He seemed so little disturbed by
it that I did not trouble for some time to
talk to him about his wound. Besides, he
never referred to it himself. I saw him once
change the dressing, and it was then that
he explained to me in a few words how a
piece of grenade had struck him during a
skirmish. He seemed to treat the incident
with the most perfect indifference.</p>

<p>“Nothing draws me away from the front,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
he added, with a melancholy smile, “and I was
intending forthwith to return to my corps;
but the doctor is flatly opposed to it.”</p>

<p>He confessed it was not without pleasure
that he looked forward to spending the
period of convalescence in the Château de
S&mdash;&mdash;, which autumn adorned so nobly.</p>

<p>From the second week, in spite of the
state of my wound on my shoulder, I was
given permission to walk a little. Dauche
helped me with a brotherly tenderness, and
it was through his encouragement that I
was able soon to venture in the avenues of
the park.</p>

<p>The doctor who looked after us both
said to me in rather an embarrassed tone:</p>

<p>“You are going out with Lieutenant
Dauche? See that you don’t go too far.”</p>

<p>This doctor was of a reticent nature.
I did not ask for explanations; I was confident
in my recovered strength. It never
struck me&mdash;naturally enough&mdash;that the doctor
was in fact thinking of Dauche.</p>

<p>Several days went by, blessed with all
that is warm, young, affectionate in a growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
friendship. The war, among a thousand
other miseries, has compelled us to live occasionally
in the company of men whom in time
of peace we should have carefully avoided.
It was, then, with a trembling joy that I
recognised in Dauche those qualities which
would move my nature to love and affection&mdash;a
nature which had ever perhaps been unduly
difficult and uneasy. I thought that a deep
predestined purpose operated there: the men
of this age who can become my friends are
marked, and determined, in the universe
with the same mysterious sign; but I may
not know them all, and perhaps I shall never
be fated to meet my best friend.</p>

<p>The times when it did not rain we passed
in long conversations on the hillside, under
a plantation of pines and beech trees. My
young friend perceived and judged natural
objects with the innocence, freshness and
originality of a child. He spoke of his
scattered family with a stubborn faith in
their safety&mdash;a faith that usually is found
only in religious fanatics or in men unbalanced
by fame or success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>In the evening, when the approach of
darkness tended to bring back to the mind the
awful things one had experienced and made
one withdraw into oneself, he used cheerfully
to ask me to have a game of chess, and this
game of skill took us on to the threshold of
sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The pleasure I had in the company of
Dauche led me one day to tell the doctor
how much I admired his character.</p>

<p>The doctor, who was ceasing to be
young, was tall, rather bent and bald, with
a sad, timid, and kind smile on his face half-hidden
by a straggling beard.</p>

<p>“Fate,” I said, “is no respecter of
victims. It is terrible to find it striking
down natures so generous, and it is a marvel
that it has failed to produce worse effects
than it has.”</p>

<p>We began chatting as we walked with
measured steps along a narrow pathway
hidden away among the hazel trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>My companion made a queer little movement
with his shoulders and looked round
to make sure that we were alone.</p>

<p>“You appear to take great pleasure in
Dauche’s company,” he said to me, “and
it is very natural. But I have already
begged you never to prolong your walks
with him too far from the Château, and I
must repeat the warning.”</p>

<p>The tone of his voice at once made me
rather anxious, and I did not hide my amazement.</p>

<p>“Dauche,” I began, “seems to me to
be convalescing slowly but surely. Can
there be anything serious in that scar on his
forehead?”</p>

<p>The doctor had stopped. He was trying
to dislodge, with the tip of his boot, a stone
embedded in the road.</p>

<p>“This scratch,” he said very quickly,
still looking down, “is very much more
serious than you imagine.”</p>

<p>A painful silence ensued, and as I remained
quiet, the doctor went on, with frequent
pauses:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“We are beginning to understand these
injuries of the skull. Your friend does not
know, and must not know, how serious his
condition is. He doesn’t even know that we
have failed to extract the projectile which
struck him. And even if the thing was
possible....”</p>

<p>Then suddenly the doctor went off into a
philosophical dissertation in which he seemed
to be both at his ease and at a loss, as in
a familiar labyrinth.</p>

<p>“We have accomplished much&mdash;very
much. We have even restored the dead to
life; but we cannot restore all the dead
to life. There are a few very difficult
problems.... We think we have solved
them.... I do not speak of God. The very
idea of God seems to be detached from this
immense calamity. I do not speak of God,
but of men. They must be told quite
simply: there are wounds which we cannot
cure. Therefore, let them stop inflicting such
wounds, and the question will not arise
again. That is a solution; but the members
of my profession are too proud to make that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
suggestion to the world, and the world is
too mad to listen.”</p>

<p>My respect for this digression prevented
me from interrupting; when, however, he
had finished, I whispered:</p>

<p>“Really, you say this missile&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“You can’t get at it, you understand.
Beyond reach! It’s rather degrading for
a proud man to admit it, but at least it’s
honest. And, besides, it’s a fact. Man
placed it there; and it is beyond his power
to remove it.”</p>

<p>Though embarrassed by the presence of
the doctor, I was deeply moved by his
words.</p>

<p>“Yet, in spite of it, one can live&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” he said in a grave voice, “one
can only die.”</p>

<p>We walked as far as the edge of the
wood. The clear light of an open meadow
seemed to bring the doctor back within the
bounds of professional etiquette; for he said
in a different tone:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, for having made you
consider things which must seem strange to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
a man with your point of view. I do not
regret having taken this opportunity to
speak to you about Dauche. He hasn’t, I
believe, any near relations in uninvaded
territory. You are interested in him, and
I must warn you: he is lost. I’m going
to add, since you seek his friendship, that
at any moment something will happen to
him, bringing death rapidly in its train.”</p>

<p>I had only known Dauche for a short
time, but I was overwhelmed. Some meaningless
words came to my lips. I said something
like “How terrible!” But the doctor,
with a pale smile, ended by saying:</p>

<p>“Alas! sir, you will do as I and many
others have done: you will get used to living
in the presence of men who yet share our
world, but of whom one knows without a
shadow of doubt that they are already dead.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I could not get accustomed to such a thing.
The conversation had taken place towards
noon. I spent the rest of the day in avoiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
the sight of Dauche&mdash;cowardly conduct which
found justification in my inability to conceal
my thoughts.</p>

<p>Night found me deprived of sleep, but it
was doubly useful: it gave me time to get
the better of certain impressions, and enabled
me to plead sickness for my changed disposition.</p>

<p>As I was getting out of bed, Dauche
suggested that we should both go for a walk
in the woods. I was on the point of refusing;
but his smile was so affectionate and engaging
that I hadn’t the courage to pretend
illness. Besides, the weather was radiant.</p>

<p>The brilliant sunshine in which some
vigour still remained, the delicate tints of a
landscape rich in the mists of early morning,
and perhaps a healthy desire to be cheerful
and forget&mdash;all that suddenly led my thoughts
away from the depths into which they had
sunk.</p>

<p>Dauche began running amid the tall
grass, which was slowly fading to a pale
amber. His laughter, you would have said,
was that of a boy. Recounting all kinds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
anecdotes and sayings, he played the games
loved by his own children, and sometimes
he used to stop suddenly and speak with
respect and affection of the child he did not
yet know, and of the mother who waited for
him in exile.</p>

<p>No natural thing seemed too trifling or
unworthy of attention: he delighted in the
scent of the flowers, spared a momentary
glance for every object, rubbed the fragrant
herbs between his fingers, and tasted the
blackberries and hazel nuts from the thickets.</p>

<p>He made me notice a thousand things
whose existence until then, I blush to think,
I was scarcely aware of. He dragged me
after him through an endless series of adventures,
and I could only follow him, awkwardly
and grumbling, like an old man forced
to dance a <em>ronde</em>.</p>

<p>We were returning to the Château, congratulating
ourselves on our appetite and on
the good time that we had had, when, in the
bend of a path, the words and the warning
of the doctor burst with a shock upon my
consciousness. It was like a sharp imperious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
rap of the knuckle against a door. I was
aware then that I had never ceased thinking
of it in my subconsciousness. But looking
once again at Dauche, sturdy and blond like
an ear of corn in the splendour of noon, I
shook my head, saying decidedly, “This
worthy doctor is mistaken.”</p>

<p>And, during the whole of that day, I
remained happy.</p>

<p>The next day, as I took a long time getting
up, and, musing idly, counted the gay flowers
on the curtains, I caught, not far from
me, the regular breathing of Dauche, who
was still sleeping. Immediately a voice
whispered in my ear, “That man is going
to die.”</p>

<p>I turned over on my other side, and the
voice repeated, “That man over there is a
dead man.”</p>

<p>Then I was seized with a desire to go away,&mdash;far
away from Dauche and from the
Château, and to bury myself in the noise and
activity of civilian France.</p>

<p>I was completely awake, and began to
reason the matter out with cold deliberation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“After all, I’ve known this man for so
short a time and can do nothing to help him.
He has been in the hands of skilled surgeons
who have exhausted all the resources of their
art for him.... I would forget his terrible
fate, as I had every right to in view of the
fact that it was shared by a large number of
young men equally worthy of attention. My
presence could be of no use to him, and to
be with him must indeed often draw upon
those reserves of moral energy of which I was
strongly in need.”</p>

<p>These arguments ended in my asking the
doctor, when I found myself alone with him
that same morning on some pretext or other,
to hasten my removal to another hospital.</p>

<p>“From the present state of your wound,”
he said to me, “I see no objection to it. I’ll
see the thing is done.”</p>

<p>This ready assent, though so gratifying,
caused me some surprise. But my eye
meeting the doctor’s, I found him looking so
sad and perplexed that I was ashamed.</p>

<p>I was, indeed, so upset by my weakness
that at the end of a quarter of an hour I went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
again to the doctor and asked if it wasn’t
possible for me to change my mind, and to
remain at the Château de S&mdash;&mdash; until I had
completely recovered.</p>

<p>He smiled with a queer satisfied expression
and assured me I could stay as long as I
liked.</p>

<p>My decision, arrived at after so much
delay and evasion, brought calm to my mind.
I passed most of the day in my room and
found diversion in reading. Towards evening
a soldier from a regiment stationed near us,
taking French leave, came to see us and
invited us to hear two musicians of his
regiment who were giving a concert in an
orange garden.</p>

<p>Though I had no precise intellectual
understanding of music, I highly appreciated
it. And at that time I was, surely, in a
position to remark how a succession of notes
and chords can interpret one’s prevailing
mood and quicken its emotions.</p>

<p>A violin sonata of Bach was being played
with piano accompaniment. Several times
I felt as if an invisible and unknown person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
touched me on the arm and whispered, “How
can you forget he is going to die?”</p>

<p>I got up as soon as the concert ended and
went quickly away, suffering veritable torture.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Dauche,
running after me. “You seem ill or unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Both,” I replied, in a voice I could no
longer control. “Didn’t you hear the music
of the violin?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said musingly; “it was pure
joy.”</p>

<p>I looked at him furtively and withdrew
nothing. But that evening, alone with my
thoughts in the dark, I understood that
chance had reserved for me a strange rôle to
play in the fate of my friend&mdash;Dauche was
doomed: he had to die: he was about to die;
but some one else, in some kind of way, had to
suffer his death-agony....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am not, I protest, different from other
people. The war had severely tried me, but
my imagination remained unclouded, and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
wound was not of such a kind as to impair
the normal working of a healthy average
brain.</p>

<p>I am, therefore, thoroughly persuaded that
the tense experience I was to undergo, from
that day, would have equally afflicted any
man confronted with the same calamitous
circumstances.</p>

<p>In spite of the sinister life of the
battlefield, I was to be in the presence of a
form of death new and terrible in its duration.
It is hardly possible to live without
at every moment visualising what is going
to happen at the next; and it was tragic to
bear in one’s consciousness a certainty which
froze, at birth, every plan and intention.
Illness creates, in ordinary life, like conditions;
but their misery is tempered by hope, or even
by the relief which comes from resignation.
On account of the war I was to undergo
an agonising experience that was unique,
and to live by the side of a man to whom I
knew the frightful day of reckoning would
suddenly come, and who had no future except
that which existed in hope and ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>This ignorance of ourselves is extremely
precious, and makes us envy that sovereign
ignorance of the beasts and plants. It enabled
Dauche to live cheerfully on the edge
of the abyss. I was there to assume the
burden of the tragedy, as if it were alien to
the human rightness of things that so much
suffering should take place without a conscious
victim.</p>

<p>The first days of November had come.
Autumn was growing less resplendent. We
had not given up our walks. I was forced to
continue them in spite of myself, for dying
Nature seemed to be giving intense expression
to our tragic friendship.</p>

<p>We often climbed the hill which looked
over the plain of Rheims. Military life
seemed, like the sap of the plants, to be
getting stiff and cold and withdrawing into
the earth. The armies were preparing for
their winter sleep. The guns boomed wearily
and without vigour. The bareness of the trees
revealed the signs of war which during
summer were hidden beneath the foliage.</p>

<p>Autumn made me feel more acutely the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
fate that was to strike down my friend,
and Dauche himself made me realise with
a cruel relentlessness the fate of all men.
The thought that this man was going to die
weighed so much on my mind that I was left
without courage, weak and useless. And, in
fact, it was the helplessness of man which
seemed to me to be solely evident as I gazed
at the curtain of poplar trees lit up with an
elusive glory.</p>

<p>Then I was powerless before the terrible
thought which haunted me: “He will never
see all this again.”</p>

<p>There is in the memoirs of Saint-Simon
a frightful page on the death of Louis XIV.
The historian cannot describe any of the
gestures of the dying monarch without repeating,
with a persistence inspired by hate:
“And it was for the last time.”</p>

<p>In the same way I constantly thought,
when I saw my friend admiring the beauty
of autumn: “It’s for the last time....”
But my thoughts, on the contrary, were full
of pain and compassion.</p>

<p>After long hours at our outpost on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
hill, we used to make up our minds to return
when the light of the rockets began to adorn
the twilight with pale constellations.</p>

<p>Dauche appeared calm, cheerful, almost
happy, as if he were having continual
glimpses of hope.</p>

<p>He used to make plans: that was unendurable,
and I felt so irritated that I once
said:</p>

<p>“How happy you must be to dare to make
plans at such a time as this!”</p>

<p>The phrase was quite vague and general;
but as soon as it was uttered it appeared to
me cruel and malevolent. I was trying to
think how to re-say it when Dauche replied:</p>

<p>“As long as your heart beats isn’t that an
adventure in itself? And, besides, you must
defy the future if you are not to fear it.”</p>

<p>These words, so full of wisdom, perplexed
me without affording me any comfort. They
only gave rise to another cause for anxiety.
Did Dauche have any inkling of his position?</p>

<p>My mind was at that time so acutely
affected by the secret that haunted me that,
for several days, the question tortured me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>To-day, when the lapse of time enables me
to look at things with the necessary perspective,
I can state that Dauche was unaware
of the calamity awaiting him. In fact, I
never saw anything which made me suppose
he ever felt a twinge of uneasiness. I cannot
recall any word, allusion or weakness which,
had he been aware, would not have failed
to escape him and reveal to me the depths
of his consciousness.</p>

<p>But on one occasion I was again assailed
by doubt. A fellow-soldier in my regiment,
rescued by the Red Cross, lay dying, fatally
wounded in one of these numerous little
scraps which have made Hill 108 the open
wound of our sector. We went to see him on
his death-bed, and at once I hastened to get
Dauche away from the room, in which he was
inclined to linger.</p>

<p>“He is, after all, better so,” I remarked,
to break a painful silence.</p>

<p>“D’you think so? Do you really think
so?” the young man replied.</p>

<p>A mysterious impulse, which was not
mere chance, made us look into one another’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
eyes; and in those of my friend, usually so
clear, I was aware of something that quivered,
elusive, frantic, like a wreck of a ship lost in
the desolate wastes of the sea.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to change the conversation,
and I succeeded. Dauche turned back towards
life, breathing deeply, and soon breaking
into shouts of laughter, in which I joined
quite genuinely.</p>

<p>In spite of this alarming incident, I had
to recognise that Dauche suspected nothing.
What I saw in his eyes that day I would have,
without a doubt, surprised in every human
look. Moreover, the flesh is aware of things
of which the mind is not, and the sharp
anguish behind that look was perhaps like
one of those mute cries of the animal, which
are uttered without the inspiration or recognition
of consciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dauche’s wound was now healed over.
Mine required very little attention. There
was no difficulty about my recovery. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
waiting for something else. I understood
that perfectly when one day Dauche asked
me why I remained so long in the fighting
zone. I hit upon a reply in which I pleaded
our great friendship and that I had few
attachments within the country. But when
I faced the question myself I saw quite well
what was the real motive of my stay at S&mdash;&mdash;.
Always I was waiting for that something to
happen.</p>

<p>In spite of these moods, the affection
I had for Dauche continued to grow. It
had deepened with my pity, and the certainty
that death would shortly claim him
contributed not a little to exalt it. I was
by nature inclined to be emotional, and I
became passionately devoted to him. I experienced
all the apprehensions of a woman
who tends a sick child, and is filled with
despair on the slightest symptoms or movements.</p>

<p>There was in the park a tennis court,
on which a few worm-eaten wickets were
lying. Dauche hit them often with some
worn bowls which the moisture was fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
rotting. One morning, as he was throwing
one of these bowls, it crumbled into pieces
between his fingers, causing him to turn and
stumble. At once he raised his hand to his
brow, and I thought he staggered. Already I
was upon him, and I caught him in my arms.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” he said,
seeing my discomposed features.</p>

<p>“I thought your head was giving you
pain.”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied smiling; “not at all.
I was readjusting my bandages.”</p>

<p>Another time, when I dropped a book I
was running through very abstractedly, he
bent down, with his usual alacrity, to pick it
up. I thought he was slow in rising again,
as if he was trying to master an attack of
giddiness. Leaning forward, I at once took
the book from his hands. His eyes were
veiled with a thin reddish film. Perhaps I
imagined that, for it did not last a moment.</p>

<p>“I forbid you,” I said, making a painful
effort to be jocular&mdash;“I forbid you to play
any other part than that of a convalescent.”</p>

<p>He looked at me, amazed, and asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“Do you want me to believe that I
am ill?”</p>

<p>This reply showed me how tactless I had
been, and I saw that I must carefully take
myself in hand if I were to hide the anxiety
which obsessed me.</p>

<p>Henceforth I was never free from it.
I noticed everything my friend ate or drank,
not daring to advise him, and itching sometimes
to do so.</p>

<p>I got clear away by myself and read
in secret some medical treatise which tended
rather to lead me astray than instruct me.
I made a thousand resolutions and plans
and rejected them in turn. They would all
have been ridiculous, or even comic, if death
had not been at hand, sacred and solemn.</p>

<p>That night I awoke startled several
times, and I listened to the breathing of
my companion, convinced, with the slightest
pause, the slightest change in the rhythm,
that he was dying&mdash;that he was dead.</p>

<p>We had not given up our walks, but I
had abruptly shortened them, without saying
why. I discovered a thousand round-about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
ways in order to avoid a rocky or slippery
road; I pushed aside the branches that
grew across the paths with a care that could
not fail to arouse suspicion. Sometimes,
in the course of a little excursion, feeling
that we had gone far from the village, I
suddenly experienced an overpowering terror
which made me silent and stupid.</p>

<p>I had given up chess, excusing myself
on the ground of fatigue, which soon indeed
was no longer feigned. A time came when
all these emotions seriously affected my
health. I kept my bed for several days
without being at all rested. I would rather
have been left to myself absolutely; but
the thought of Dauche going out alone and
not able to take care of himself was unendurable.
I could not imagine that the
fatality was to take place without my being
present, because I was always expectant,
waiting....</p>

<p>So he always stayed with me, and used
to pass the time by reading out to me.
I often wished to stop him and, being
unable to say that I felt anxious on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
account, I complained of my head. The
thing is unbelievable. It was I who looked
like the man who was doomed, and it was he
who seemed to be in full possession of his
strength. I was right in what I said: I
was undergoing on his behalf the pangs of
death.</p>

<p>One night, during his first sleep, he uttered
a kind of moan so strangely animal in quality,
that at once I was on my feet, and I gazed
at him for a long time in the glow of the
night-light.</p>

<p>The emotion I felt that night was mingled
with something like an intense desire for
freedom. I was horrified to discover that
my sick soul not only waited for the inevitable
thing, but was dominated by a
longing for the end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I got up about the beginning of December,
and our first walk was in the pinewoods that
clustered on the sandy hills south of the main
road from Rheims to Soissons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>The afternoon was coming to a close.
A wild west wind raged through this war-scarred
valley which, from ancient times,
had borne the ravaging ebb and flow of
invasion.</p>

<p>We were walking side by side, feeling
rather chilled and silent, given up to those
formless thoughts that find no expression
in the spoken word and which are of the
very colour and fabric of the soul.</p>

<p>We got rather warm in climbing a hill,
and when we got to the top I suggested
we should sit and rest ourselves on the
trunk of a beech tree that lay mutilated on
the ground, and from which oozed a yellow
liquid streaked with purple.</p>

<p>I was worn out, without hope, without
courage, having lost all interest in my doings,
in the condition of a man whose will fails
him and who gives up the agonising struggle.</p>

<p>Is it possible that there can be, between
two beings, relations so mysteriously intimate?
Is it true that it was I who on
that day gave up the struggle?</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with misery, I stood up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
quite involuntarily, and, with unseeing eyes,
I gazed towards the horizon at the leaping
flight of hills bristling with trees.</p>

<p>Was it really a queer noise that made me
turn round? Wasn’t it rather a shock or a
lacerating sensation taking place within me?
The fact is that, all of a sudden, I knew that
behind me something was happening. And
then my heart began to beat violently, for
it could only be the thing&mdash;the frightful and
expected thing....</p>

<p>It was!</p>

<p>Dauche had slipped from the tree-trunk.
It was some time before I recognised him;
his whole body was shaken by convulsions&mdash;hideous,
inhuman, like an animal struck down
by the butcher’s mallet. His feet and his
hands were contracted and twitching. His
face was purple and forced round towards the
right shoulder. He foamed at the mouth and
showed his white eyeballs.</p>

<p>I feel a kind of shame in describing this
scene. I had often been in the presence of
death, and the war had made me live in
horrible intimacy with it; but I had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
seen anything so frightful and so bestial. I,
in my turn, began to tremble, as if the shiver
of the victim was contagious, and my feeling
of despair and nausea grew more intense.</p>

<p>That lasted for an eternity of time, during
which I never moved. I let death do its work
and I waited until it had finished. Gradually,
however, I became aware of a lull, and the
grip on the victim seemed to relax.</p>

<p>Dauche’s body remained rigid, inert. A
feeble moan escaped his lips.</p>

<p>At the same moment I recovered from
my stupor and, in spite of my paralysed will,
I set about removing from this place what
had once been my friend.</p>

<p>In raising him from the ground I suffered
terrible pain. His muscles were contracted
and he was terribly heavy. I caught hold
of him with my arms round his body and
carried him with his breast on mine, like a
sleeping child. A thin stream of frothy
saliva oozed from the corners of his mouth,
as from the snouts of cattle in harness. His
head began to sway heavily.</p>

<p>Night was falling. I had to put my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
burden down every few yards, then take it
up again.</p>

<p>My wound caused me acute suffering, but
my mind was benumbed and my movements
almost involuntary.</p>

<p>I do not know how I came within sight
of the Château. On reaching the foot of the
hill, suddenly, in the bend of an avenue, I
met the doctor, who had been taking a
solitary walk. It was almost dark; I did
not see the expression on his face.</p>

<p>I placed the body on the ground, kneeled
down beside it, my face streaming with perspiration,
and said, “Here he is.” Then I
began to weep.</p>

<p>There were cries, shouts and lights. They
carried away Dauche’s body, and I was carried
too.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was really two days later that Dauche
died. I did not wish to see him again. I
had been placed in a room far removed from
him, where I lived in a kind of semi-delirium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
asking from hour to hour, “Has the end
come? Has it ended?”</p>

<p>But I knew when the end came before I
was told, and I let myself fall into a dark
dreamless sleep, of which I still retain the
most despairing impression.</p>

<p>It appears that Dauche was buried in the
little cemetery skirted by the birch and dead
fir trees that are to be seen at the village of
C.... in an arid field of white sand. I
never could get myself to visit him there.
But I carried away with me a more sombre
grave that time will not efface.</p>

<p>I left the Château de S&mdash;&mdash; towards the
middle of December. I was weak and enfeebled,
weary with the thought that it was
now my own life I must live, and undergo for
myself the struggle of my own life and death.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">COUSIN’S PROJECTS</h2>
</div>


<p>Whenever I had a minute to spare
I went and sat at the foot of Cousin’s
bed. He said to me:</p>

<p>“See, there’s room for you now that
they’ve cut my legs off. One would think
they’d done it on purpose.”</p>

<p>This man of forty had a young and
delicate face. On “shaving days,” when
the razor had done its work, it did one
good to see the everlasting, trustful smile of
Cousin. It was a wonderful smile&mdash;rather
delicate, rather ironical, rather candid, rather
convulsive; the very smile of the race,
made with lips discoloured by the loss of
blood, and features drawn by long and
weary effort. In spite of everything, Cousin
had a confiding look&mdash;the air of one who
trusted absolutely the whole world, and
especially himself, because he lived, because
he was Cousin.</p>

<p>One leg remained to him which, to speak
frankly, was worth nothing at all. The
joint of the knee had been smashed by
the explosion of a torpedo. It was a bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
business, of which people spoke in low voices,
shaking their heads.</p>

<p>But, what matter? Cousin did not put
his trust in his legs. Already he had
abandoned one; he did not seem to care
much about a leg more or less. Cousin,
I think, did not put his trust in any particular
part of his chest, or his head, or his limbs.
With or without legs, he was himself, and
in his clear green eyes burnt a generous flame
that was the expression of a pure soul.</p>

<p>Whilst I was sitting on his bed Cousin
told me all about himself. He always took
up the thread of events at the point where
the war had broken it off, and he had a
natural inclination to unite the happy past of
Peace to a future not less delicious. Across
the troubled and bloody abyss he loved to
stretch the life of yesterday until it touched
the life of to-morrow. Never a verb in the
past tense, but an eternal and miraculous
present.</p>

<p>“I am a dealer in <em>objets d’art</em>,” he told
me. “It’s a profitable business when one
understands it. I trade mostly in candelabras<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and chandeliers. I work with Cohen
and Co., with Marguillé, with Smithson, with
all the great houses. Now, I have my own
special way of working: I keep my client
to myself, and I undertake to make him
understand what he wants and to deliver
the goods.</p>

<p>“Suppose that a M. Barnabé comes and
asks me for a drawing-room chandelier.
I say, ‘Right! I see what you want’; and
I jump into a taxi. I get to Messrs. Cohen’s.
‘It’s 25 per cent. commission. Is that
understood?’ Let us imagine that Cohen
makes difficulties. Right! I run downstairs,
jump into the taxi again, and go to
Smithson’s.... Certainly it can be an expensive
game. Supposing that Barnabé goes
back on me&mdash;well, then, I am left with the
taxi to pay for.... But it’s interesting!
It’s a trade that keeps you going; it amuses
you; you need to have discrimination.”</p>

<p>Looking at the animated face of Cousin,
I smiled. His cheeks were like imitation
marble, not very good; he had the swollen
eyes of a man who had lain too long in bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
with fever, and whose “inside” was not
very healthy. At forty one may feel one’s
heart young, but one’s flesh does not react
from the effects of a torpedo as it does at
twenty. I looked at the legless Cousin with
astonishment while he explained to me how,
in his trade, one rushed upstairs at Cohen’s;
how one jumped about at Marguillé’s; how
one ran down Smithson’s stairs.</p>

<p>A day came when Cousin’s leg began to
bleed. The blood filtered through the bandage
in great drops, like scarlet sweat, or like
morning dew on the leaves of a cabbage.
During four or five days Cousin’s wound
bled nearly every day. Every time he was
carried away in haste; they put all sorts
of things into his wound, and the blood ceased
to flow. Every time Cousin came back to
his bed a little paler, and he said to me as
he passed:</p>

<p>“There, you see ... one never gets any
peace.”</p>

<p>One morning I went to sit beside Cousin,
who was making his toilette. He was out
of breath. In spite of the puffiness of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
face, one felt it had grown thin, formless,
devoured by an internal malady. Really, it
reminded one of a fruit rotten with vermin.</p>

<p>“I have,” he told me, “good news of
my boys&mdash;twelve and thirteen years old.
They’re getting on! Didn’t I tell you? I
am thinking of taking on, as well as the
candelabras, clocks and chimneypieces. With
the connection that I have, I mean to do
great things. One must always aim high.
<em>Dame!</em> I shall have to get a move on. But
I’ll manage, I’ll manage. What one needs
is to know the styles....”</p>

<p>I tried to smile, without being able to
control a contraction of the heart. Cousin
seemed uplifted by a sort of lyrical ecstasy.
He brandished his towel in one hand, and his
soap in the other. He described his great
future career as if he saw it spread out,
written in big letters on the whiteness of the
sheets.</p>

<p>On the sheet, which I was just looking at,
there appeared suddenly a blot&mdash;a red blot
which enlarged itself rapidly into a terrifying
and splendid stain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” murmured Cousin, “it’s
bleeding again. One never gets any
peace.”</p>

<p>I had called for help. A waterproof
sheet was folded round Cousin’s thigh.</p>

<p>He said, “It’s all right; it’s all right. No
need to worry.”</p>

<p>He said this in a voice that was emphatic
but very weak&mdash;a voice made with the lips
alone.</p>

<p>The blood ceased to flow, and they
carried Cousin once again to the operating-table.
There, he had a moment’s peace. The
surgeons were washing their hands. I heard
them consulting in low voices on Cousin’s case,
and this made my heart beat and dried the
tongue in my mouth.</p>

<p>Cousin saw me a long way off, and made
me a little sign with his eyelids. I came close
to him. He said to me:</p>

<p>“One never gets any peace. Ah! what was
it I was saying to you? Yes, I was talking to
you about styles. My strong point is that I
understand the different styles&mdash;the Louis XV,
the Empire, the Dutch, the Modern, and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
others. But it’s difficult. I want to explain
to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Go to sleep, Cousin,” said the surgeon
softly.</p>

<p>“I will explain all that to you when these
gentlemen have done with me, when I wake
up.”</p>

<p>Then, submissively, he began to breathe
in the ether.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is now a year since all this happened.
I often think of the explanations that Cousin
never gave me&mdash;that he will never give me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE LADY IN GREEN</h2>
</div>


<p>I do not know why I loved Rabot.
Every morning as I went to and
fro at my usual work in the ward, I
saw Rabot, or rather Rabot’s head, or less
still Rabot’s eye, hiding in a hurly-burly of
sheets. He was a little like a guinea-pig
that rubs its nose in the straw and watches
you anxiously.</p>

<p>Every time I passed I made a familiar
sign to Rabot. This sign consisted in shutting
the left eye energetically and pressing
the lips together. At once Rabot’s eye shut
itself, digging a thousand little wrinkles in
the withered face of the sick man. And that
was all; we had exchanged our salutations
and our confidences.</p>

<p>Rabot never laughed. He had spent his
babyhood in a foundling hospital and had not
had enough milk. This under-feeding in infancy
can never be made up for afterwards.</p>

<p>Rabot was sandy-haired, with a pale
complexion splashed with freckles. He had
so little brain that he looked like a rabbit
or a bird. Directly a stranger spoke to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
him his underlip began to tremble and his
chin wrinkled all over like a walnut. You
had first of all to explain to him that you
were not going to beat him.</p>

<p>Poor Rabot! I would have given anything
to see him laugh. Everything, on
the contrary, seemed to conspire to make
him cry: there were the terrible endless
dressings that had to be renewed every day
for months; then he was compelled to lie so
quiet and motionless that he was never able
to play with his comrades. And after all,
the fact remained that Rabot had never
learned to play at all, and really was not
much interested in anything.</p>

<p>I was, I think, the only one who became
at all intimate with him; and, as I said
before, this intimacy consisted chiefly in
shutting my left eye when I passed near
his bed.</p>

<p>Rabot did not smoke. When cigarettes
were handed round he would join in with
the others and play with them for a moment,
moving his great thin fingers, deformed and
emaciated. Long illness seems to rob the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
fingers of manual labourers of all beauty
and significance: directly they lose their
hardness and their healthy appearance they
look like nothing at all in the world.</p>

<p>I think that Rabot would have willingly
offered his good cigarettes to his neighbours;
but it is so difficult to talk sometimes,
especially to give something to some one.
The cigarettes got slowly covered with dust
on the table, and Rabot lay flat on his
back, quite thin and straight, like a bit
of straw carried away by the torrent of
war, and understanding nothing of what was
happening all around him.</p>

<p>One day a staff officer came into the
ward and went up to Rabot.</p>

<p>“That is the man,” he said. “Well,
I have brought him the Military Medal and
the Croix de Guerre.”</p>

<p>He made Rabot sign a little paper and
left him alone with his playthings. Rabot
did not laugh. He put the case out on
the bedclothes in front of him, and he looked
at it from nine o’clock in the morning till
three in the afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>At three the officer returned, and
said:</p>

<p>“I made a mistake. The decorations
were not for Rabot, but for Raboux.”</p>

<p>Then he took the jewel-case, tore up the
receipt, and went away.</p>

<p>Rabot cried from three o’clock in the
afternoon till nine o’clock in the evening.
Then he went to sleep. The next morning
he began to cry again. M. Gossin, who is
a good Director, went to Headquarters and
came back with a medal and a cross just like
the last; he even made Rabot sign another
paper.</p>

<p>Rabot stopped crying. But his face was
still haunted by a shadow&mdash;the shadow of
a constant dread, as if he feared that one day
or other they would come and take away all
his treasures.</p>

<p>Some weeks passed. I often looked at
Rabot’s face, and I tried to imagine what
laughter would make of it. I imagined and
looked in vain; it was obvious that Rabot
did not know how to laugh, and that his face
was not made that way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>It was then that the lady in green arrived.</p>

<p>She came in one fine morning through one
of the doors, like everybody else. On the
other hand, she was not like everybody else:
she was more like an angel, a queen, or a doll.
She was not dressed like the nurses who
worked in the wards, or like the mothers and
wives who came to visit their wounded
husbands and sons. She was not even like
the women one meets in the streets. She
was much more beautiful, much more majestic.
She made one think of the fairies of
one’s childhood, or of those splendid forms
one sees on great coloured calendars under
which the artist has written “Reveries,” or
“Melancholy,” or “Poetry.” She was surrounded
by well-dressed, good-looking officers,
who attended to her slightest word, and
who lavished on her the most extravagant
compliments.</p>

<p>“Come in, then, Madame,” said one of
them, “since you wish to see some of our
wounded.”...</p>

<p>She made two steps into the room, stopped
short, and said in a deep voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“The poor things!”</p>

<p>Every one in the ward opened his eyes
and pricked up his ears. Mery put down
his pipe; Tarrissant changed his crutches
from one hand to the other, which, with him,
is a sign of emotion; Domenge and Burnier
stopped playing and pressed their cards
against their bodies to hide them. Poupot
did not move, because he is paralysed, but
one could easily see that he was listening
with all his might.</p>

<p>The lady in green went first to Sorri, the
negro.</p>

<p>“Your name is Sorri?” she asked, reading
his card.</p>

<p>The negro moved his head; the lady in
green went on in a voice as sweet and
melodious as an actress:</p>

<p>“You have come to fight for France,
Sorri; and you have left your beautiful
country&mdash;the fresh and smiling oasis in an
ocean of burning sand. Ah, Sorri! how
beautiful are the African evenings, at the
hour when the young woman returns along
the avenue of palm trees, carrying on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
head an aromatic pitcher full of honey and
cocoanut milk!”</p>

<p>The officers murmured their appreciation,
and Sorri, who understands French, repeated,
nodding his head, “Cocoa! cocoa!”</p>

<p>Already the lady in green was gliding away
over the tiled floor. She came to Rabot, and
sat down on the end of his bed, like a swallow
on a telegraph wire.</p>

<p>“Rabot,” she said, “you are a brave
man!”</p>

<p>Rabot did not answer; but in his usual
way he blinked his eyes, like a child who fears
a blow.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rabot!” said the lady in green,
“what gratitude do we not owe you, who
have guarded safely for us our dear France!
But, Rabot, you have already gained the great
reward. Glory! The joy of battle! The
exquisite agony of plunging forward, your
bayonet shining in the sun! The pleasure
of plunging the iron of vengeance into the
bleeding side of the enemy! And then the
suffering&mdash;divine suffering to be endured for
the sake of all; the sacred wound which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
of a hero, makes a god! Ah! wonderful
memories, Rabot!”</p>

<p>The lady in green ceased, and a religious
silence reigned in the ward.</p>

<p>Then something unexpected happened.</p>

<p>Rabot stopped looking like himself. All
his features contracted, changing in an almost
tragic way. A hoarse noise burst forth in
spasms from his fleshless chest, and all the
world realised that Rabot was laughing.</p>

<p>He laughed for over three-quarters of an
hour. Long after the lady in green had gone,
Rabot was still laughing&mdash;in fits, as one
coughs, with a rattling noise.</p>

<p>After that the life of Rabot changed a
little. When he was on the verge of tears
and misery one could sometimes distract his

one said at the right moment:</p>

<p>“Rabot! they are going to bring the
lady in green to see you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IN THE VINEYARD</h2>
</div>


<p>Between Epernay and Château-Thierry,
the Marne flows through an
exquisite valley, whose gay hills are
rich in orchards and vine plantations, and
crowned with verdure like woodland goddesses,
and abundantly adorned with those
plants which have made France a country
without price, beautiful and noble.</p>

<p>It is the valley of rest. Jaulgonne,
Dormans, Châtillons, Œuilly, Port-à-Binson&mdash;those
old smiling villages can never be repaid
for lavishing such hours of forgetful repose,
that refresh like spring water, on the exhausted
troops leaving Verdun for the once
quiet sectors of the Aisne.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1916 the &mdash;&mdash;
Corps was once again concentrated on the
Marne, ready to take its share in the
immense and bloody sacrifice on the Somme
front. Our battalion was patiently waiting
the word which would send them up the
line; as they waited, they passed the time
in calculating, from the top of the hills, the
number of waggons that could be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
struggling along far down in the valley, and
as usual they made all sorts of conjectures.</p>

<p>Most of the time we passed in the fields
with our friends, avoiding serious thought
as much as possible, and letting the body
enjoy to the full the repose which offered
itself far from the murderous struggles on
the front.</p>

<p>There had been a few days of dazzling
heat, then the storm had come with a
thundering sky, the clouds wildly charging,
and a wide sweeping wind carrying along
with it the dust or the mist.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon we happened to be on
the road which rises gently from Chavenay
to the copses of the south.</p>

<p>There were three of us. Conversation
flagged, and, imperceptibly, we had each
fallen back on our secret thoughts&mdash;thoughts
that were full of pain, and which the climbing
road seemed to make harder to bear.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit down on this bank,” said a
voice softly.</p>

<p>Without replying, we found ourselves
all at once lying in the silver-weed. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
tore it up abstractedly, like men who are
obliged to work their muscles in order to
think more freely.</p>

<p>A little grape-vine was growing at our feet
and reached, with two graceful efforts, a
ridge of earth gleaming with the freshness
of wet grass. It was a neat, pure little
vine of Champagne, bursting with juice,
cared for like a divine and sacred thing.
No wild plants; nothing but the stubbly
vine-stock and the soil&mdash;that rich soil which
the rains wash away and which, each season,
the peasants carry up again, on their backs,
right to the summit of the hills.</p>

<p>From amid this blend of green herbage
we saw suddenly emerging an old thin
woman, with a rusty complexion and hair
white and disordered. In one hand she
held a pail full of ashes, and with the other
scattered handfuls of it on the feet of the
vines.</p>

<p>On seeing us, she stopped, and adjusted
with a dusty finger a coil of hair blown about
by the wind. She stared at us. Then she
spoke:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“What’s your regiment, you others?”</p>

<p>“The 110th line, Madame.”</p>

<p>“Mine did not belong to that regiment.”</p>

<p>“You have boys in the army?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I had once.”</p>

<p>There was silence, broken by the cry of
animals, the gusts of the high wind, and the
hissing murmur of the shaken foliage. The
old woman scattered a few handfuls of the
ashes, and then came near and began in a
stumbling voice that often lost itself in the
wind:</p>

<p>“I once had boys in the army. Now I
have none. The two youngest are dead. I
have one remaining&mdash;a poor wretch, who is
hardly a soldier now.”</p>

<p>“He is wounded, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is wounded. He has lost both
arms.”</p>

<p>The old woman put her bucket of ashes
on the ground, removed some grass from her
waist-belt and tied a wayward vine branch to
a supporting stick, and, standing erect again,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“He has been wounded as few have been.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
He has lost his two arms, and in his thigh
there is a hole big enough to contain a small
bowl of milk. For ten days he was on the
verge of death. I went to see him, and I
said to him:</p>

<p>“‘Clovis, you are not going to leave me all
alone?’&mdash;for I must tell you they had been for
a long while without a father.</p>

<p>“And he always used to reply:</p>

<p>“‘I’ll be better to-morrow.’</p>

<p>“No one was gentler than this boy.”</p>

<p>We remained silent. One of us at length
murmured:</p>

<p>“Your boy is brave, Madame!”</p>

<p>The old woman, who was looking at her
grape-vine, turned her dim eyes towards us
and said in an abrupt tone:</p>

<p>“Brave! of course! My boys could not
be anything else!”</p>

<p>A laugh escaped her&mdash;a laugh almost of
pride, a strangled laugh that lost itself at
once in the wind. Then she appeared to talk
absently:</p>

<p>“My poor unfortunate son will some day
be able to look forward to marriage, for there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
is no one so gentle as he is. But my two
youngest, my two little ones! It’s too much!
Oh, God, it’s too much!”</p>

<p>We could find nothing to say. There was
nothing to say. With hair flying in the wind,
she began again to scatter the ashes, like a
sower of death. Her lips were compressed,
and in her face there was a mixture of despair,
bewilderment and defiance.</p>

<p>“What are you doing this for, Madame?”
I asked, somewhat at random.</p>

<p>“You see, I’m mixing the ashes with
the sulphate. It’s the season. I shall never
finish: I’ve too much to do, too much to do.”</p>

<p>We had got up, as if we felt ashamed of
disturbing this tireless worker in her task.
Moved by a common impulse, we took off
our hats to her.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said, “and good luck,
too, you others.”</p>

<p>We climbed up the hill to the very edge
of the wood without saying a word. Then
we turned round and had a last look at the
valley.</p>

<p>There on the hillside, in a mosaic of plots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
as it were, the vine plantation could be seen,
with the old woman, ever so small, who was
still sowing the ashes in the wind heavy with
rain clouds. The gentle country maintained
in face of the stormy heavens an attitude of
innocence and resignation. Here and there,
humble villages that glistened seemed to be
set like coloured jewels in the earth. And
right in the fields that were dressed for the
needs of August, small specks that moved
could be seen: a race of old men were at grips
with the soil.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE RAILWAY JUNCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>To die is simple enough; only you
should have the good taste to die in
some selected spot&mdash;unless, of course,
you are in China, where the dead are supreme
and exercise almost more authority than the
living. But in our country you have got
to die properly, otherwise the living will
look askance at you and say, “What does
this corpse want? There’s no room for it
here.”</p>

<p>In 1915 I was going through a kind of
probation period at the railway junction of
X., and I went on duty two or three times
a week. Going on duty meant being on
the spot and doing small insignificant jobs,
being on guard or making a note of what
was passing. Usually the man in charge
used to be found in some gloomy place
leading to the lamp-room. There he endured
the long weary hours without interruption,
and watched the military trains passing,
full of men who had undergone six months’
campaigning. They sang while they journeyed
from one hell to another, because in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
war men do not let their thoughts travel
far; as soon as they have got away from
the guns they abandon themselves without
restraint to the joy of being alive.</p>

<p>One Saturday night I was lying on a
thick mattress which served as a bed. It
was alive with mice. I felt these amiable
little beasts at a finger’s length from my
ears, and I listened with wandering attention
to the noises coming from the junction.
They were the sounds of a great railway
station: whistles, shrieks, puffing engines,
cries of the winches and the cranes, the
vibrations of the taut iron rails, the sharp
clatter of the signals, the repeated clash of
the buffers of colliding trucks; and in the
midst of it all, the clamour and the rhythm
of military movements, the swing of a
detachment on the march, the challenges
of the sentries, commands, bell-ringings&mdash;all
those things which indicate the forcible
possession by armed might of the industrial
organism.</p>

<p>My thoughts were running along these
lines when I saw Corporal Bonardent entering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
my dug-out, blinding me with the flare of
his acetylene lamp.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant!”</p>

<p>“I’m all attention, Bonardent.”</p>

<p>“Some poor devil in the food transport
has just got himself done in, on the semi-permanent
way 17. I’m told it’s a dreadful&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Let’s go there at once, Corporal!”</p>

<p>Two men were waiting for me outside with
a stretcher. It was a glorious night, upon
which the pale and flickering lights of the
station hardly made an impression.</p>

<p>“It’s at La Folie,” said Bonardent: “it’s
rather far from here.”</p>

<p>La Folie is a road-crossing, about a mile
off. I asked a porter how to get there, and
we started.</p>

<p>What is really amazing, in a large station,
is that the organising imperative will which
directs the rush of moving things lies hidden
behind an apparent state of chaos and
entanglement. We began to walk along
lines of trucks that never ended. They
seemed to have been left there and forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
since the beginning of the war&mdash;rolling-stock
that appeared to have had its day, with
stiffened axles and couplings devoured by
rust; but suddenly our lamp would light
up an open door, and some soldiers were
seen in a heap, sleeping on the straw, or
there were cattle with stupefied looks. A
few compartments had been turned into
travelling offices, where clerks drudged
through a mass of papers in a light reflected
from a drawing-room lamp-shade; one felt
that the terrible grasp of the administration
had closed over the railways, just as its
monstrous grip was in possession from the
deep-dug trenches to the outfitting shops
far away in the Pyrenees. Sometimes, crossing
wide, dark spaces, we slipped between
two trains that seemed petrified with eternal
sleep; but all at once, though no one could
be seen, the trains began to move towards
each other, their ends clashing with a terrific
clatter. Farther on we had to stop while
hospital trains were passing. They afforded
little comfort then, and there came to us,
as the trains went by, a broadside of heart-rending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
coughs and puffs of the saturated
chloride air with which the hospitals reeked.
In addition, there were masses of fat mortars
lashed on trucks, heaps of kitchens on wheels,
and machinery whose uses one could not
possibly guess, and all sorts of munitions of
war, which night made fantastic. Heavy
circular armour protected the cowering
engines snorting in the pale light of the arc
lamps. There were also, reminding one of
former times, suburban trains that bore
along drowsy passengers and express trains
that swept over the intricate lines swift as
a lash of the whip. In a word, a tumultuous
roar, in which military movements clashed
with the routine of civilian life.</p>

<p>At last we arrived at La Folie. It was
an inextricable network of railways, discs,
switches and metal cables. Three aged railway
workers were living there in a shed.
They were in shirt sleeves, and were turning
the cranks, pulling the switches, directing
with an orderly calm born of experience all
the whirling forces which accumulated in that
spot. They made me think of the foremen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
in past times who used to carry on when
the managing directors were indulging in
the pleasures of social life.</p>

<p>Above the rumbling noises a telegraph
bell could be heard patiently ringing.</p>

<p>“We have come for the A.S.C. man,”
said Bonardent.</p>

<p>“Oh! for that poor devil. He is there,
under the sack and all around. My God!”</p>

<p>We entered the zone occupied by the
corpse. I say “zone” deliberately, for the
poor wretch had been cut up and scattered
like a handful of grain at seed-time.</p>

<p>“God in Heaven!” said a railwayman
with white hair; “why did the poor man
come off the truck without looking round
first? He made a terrible mistake. Here
there is too much traffic for anyone to leave
one’s post.”</p>

<p>The face of the dead man was intact,
but sixty trucks had passed over his body,
splitting it diagonally from the feet to the
shoulders. We picked up, in one place and
another, the remains&mdash;bleeding pieces of flesh,
intestines, and, as I well remember, a hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
clutching a piece of cheese. Death had struck
the man as he was eating.</p>

<p>The extraordinary thing was that his overcoat
remained whole: it concealed from view
the hideous annihilation of the body. Lifting
it slightly, I saw his discipline book, on which
one could decipher the name Lamailleux.</p>

<p>“I think,” I said, “we’ve got him all
now.”</p>

<p>An electric lamp, perched high up, gave
a fitful light and seemed to be suffering
from irritating twitches.</p>

<p>I decided that we should take a short cut
back across “The Artillery”&mdash;a huge siding
where munition trains had been shunted.
But, as we got near the railways, a sentry
appeared:</p>

<p>“Halt! Who goes there?”</p>

<p>None of us had thought of the password.
The territorial barred the way with his rifle.
He was adamant:</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Lieutenant, but you must
go another way: those are my orders.”</p>

<p>A long turning brought us before another
sentry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“The password, please! You can’t go
through ‘The Artillery’ without it.”</p>

<p>“My friend, we are taking away a dead
body.”</p>

<p>I raised the corner of the sacking and
uncovered the bluish face. In the light of
the acetylene a portion of the pale skin
with some tattooed marks could be seen
through the chaotic heap of clothes that
were saturated with blood. A look of horror
passed over the guard’s face, but he said
again:</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, go along the main line!
It’s not possible this way.”</p>

<p>We plunged back again along the network
of rails, disturbed by the clatter of the signals
and the rumbling convoys. Sometimes the exhausted
stretcher-bearers stopped and placed
their burden on the stony embankment and
carefully spat on their hands. Trains went
by, and we could see, in the bright compartments,
women reading, tightly clasping
beautiful children who had fallen asleep.</p>

<p>At last the station lights came into
view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“Where are we taking the corpse?” I
asked Bonardent.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>I finally decided to present myself at the
<em>Petite Vitesse</em>. A room there had been taken
to receive the wreckage cast off from the
swirling activity of the railway station&mdash;lost
trunks, unemployed men, riderless beasts,
stores with no destination, and, when necessary,
corpses. A gendarme was smoking a
cigarette in front of the door.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, there’s no room here to-day.
It’s full of fugitives from the north, with their
kids and packages.”</p>

<p>I uttered a few words of encouragement
to my men, and made up my mind to
try the “draft-pavilion.” It was occupied
by detachments that were rejoining their
corps. The men were sleeping in heaps on
the straw.</p>

<p>“Oh! you must see it’s quite impossible
to put it here with the men,” said an adjutant,
shaking his head. He added, as if to excuse
himself:</p>

<p>“Put yourself in my place, Lieutenant. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
have no authority.... I can’t take charge
of a corpse without orders....”</p>

<p>I sat down on a stone. The stretcher-bearers,
worn out, mopped their brows and
uttered the word “Drink!” I looked at the
shapeless mass of Lamailleux, which seemed
quite indifferent to this last cross it had to
bear, and it waited for its eternal resting-place
with the sovereign patience of death.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you are well acquainted
with the station,” said the Adjutant to me;
“but there’s a guard-room there for the
transport men stationed here. I’ll go and
see.”</p>

<p>I let him go and began to smoke, contemplating
the night, which was warm and
glorious. The tranquillity of the objects
seemed, like the agitation of the men, to say
distinctly: “Why is this man upsetting us all
with this useless corpse?” And an insect,
ecstatic in the rare grass, emitted a sharpening
crescendo of sound like a little being who
imagines that the whole earth exists and was
made for him.</p>

<p>The Adjutant emerged from the darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“It’s most unfortunate. A man is locked
up there for drunkenness: he has been sick
all over the place.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right! Let’s go and see the
station-master.”</p>

<p>He was asleep. His deputy was reading
the illustrated papers. While I stated my
case he asked me to advise him what pictures
he should cut out to stick on the walls from
among the little women of the <em>Vie fantaisiste</em>,
of which he seemed to be an inveterate
reader. As I remained surly, he said, as if in
parenthesis:</p>

<p>“As for this dreadful business, it is an
awful pity that the hospital is at the other
end of the town. You can’t go there at this
time of night. Put the thing in a truck until
to-morrow morning, old chap!”</p>

<p>Having, by this wonderful suggestion,
relieved himself of all responsibility, the young
man stuck his nose again into the illustrated
paper.</p>

<p>At that time they had not erected at the
railway stations those large hospitals of wood
and cardboard which are to be seen everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
now. The idea of the truck I did not
entertain for two seconds. In imagination
I saw this improvised mortuary starting out
during the night and taking away the corpse.
It was a mad idea!</p>

<p>I went to the postmen: they were sorting
out the letters. They were humming: “It
is I who am Nénesse.” There wasn’t room
for a rat in their hutch, and at once they
regarded the question as quite beyond their
jurisdiction....</p>

<p>I came out overcome with a kind of
annoyance. Really, nobody took the slightest
interest in my dead man. I muttered to
myself: “Why, why, Lamailleux, did you
let yourself die in a place where corpses are
not wanted, and at a moment when no one
has time to deal with them?” But even
as I said that, I felt none the less a kind of
link being established between me and this
wreckage, and I looked at it as at something
which puzzles you, but which belongs to you
in spite of everything.</p>

<p>“Where shall we put the poor man?” said
Bonardent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Then the simplest solution struck me.</p>

<p>“Follow me,” I said.</p>

<p>Quietly we went back towards the lamp-room.</p>

<p>“There’s no room there, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Proceed, Corporal.”</p>

<p>I got the stretcher carried into the room
reserved for my use.</p>

<p>“Now, put it there, alongside my mattress,
and go to bed.”</p>

<p>The men went out, shaking their heads
with amazement. I remained alone with
Lamailleux and lay down on the sheets. War
had already taught me to live and to sleep in
the company of the dead, and I was surprised
that I had not, from the first, thought of so
natural a solution.</p>

<p>For a long time, in the light of a candle,
I looked at the frightful heap which was my
night companion. There was no smell yet.
I blew out the candle and could think at
leisure.</p>

<p>From the stretcher there fell softly every
second a drop of something which must have
been blood. For a long time I counted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
drops, thinking of many things that were as
mournful as the epoch I lived in. Loud
whistles pierced the blackness, and I had
already counted several hundreds of the drops
when I fell into a sleep that was like that of
my comrade&mdash;undisturbed by dreams.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE HORSE-DEALERS</h2>
</div>


<p>They have all been summoned to
report at noon, though many of them
will not be wanted until evening.</p>

<p>There they stand round the entrance&mdash;like
a dark puddle, one would almost say;
others are scattered about in the garden,
gloomily walking up and down.</p>

<p>It is an afternoon of February. The
heavy and anxious sky is surcharged in one
limitless stretch. It appears to bear no
relation to the little events that happen
down here, so melancholy is its mood. The
wind is surly. It must know what they are
doing far away, but it says nothing; not
even the deepest rumble of the cannon is
borne along the breeze; we are far away,
and must forget....</p>

<p>The wind swirls in between the buildings,
sweeps back on itself, enraged like a wild
beast caught in a trap.</p>

<p>The men pay no attention to the sky,
or to the wind, or to the chilling light of
winter; they are thinking of themselves.</p>

<p>They do not know each other; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
have been brought here by a cause which
is common to all of them. They are so
bewildered and exhausted that they cannot
even pretend to be indifferent.</p>

<p>On a closer view, there is about them something
that sets them all into a class apart: a
lack of physical vitality, a sickly look about
the body, too much flesh or too little, eyes
blazing with fever, sometimes an obvious
infirmity, more often a wan skin faintly
coloured with very poor blood. Never a
joyous relaxation of healthy muscles: all
of them have the slow, dragging movement
of the snail.</p>

<p>Finding themselves herded together an
unendurable thought, some have started a
conversation to satisfy their pride; others
are silent, too proud to talk.</p>

<p>There are wage-earners there, professional
men, and long-haired intellectuals whose bitter
looks are veiled by spectacles.</p>

<p>Everybody smokes. Never has it been
so clear that tobacco is an anodyne for soul
sickness.</p>

<p>From time to time, two or three men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
reach the garden gate and disappear for a few
minutes. They return wiping their mouths,
their breath reeking with wine.</p>

<p>Every few minutes the door opens. A
gendarme appears and calls out some names.
Those who are called push their way through
the crowd, as if drawn by threads.</p>

<p>Their mouths twitch a little at the corners.
They affect a detached, bored, or chaffing
expression, and they vanish under the
arch.</p>

<p>They no longer see the February sky; no
longer do they breathe the cold odorous
wind: they are pushed one against the other
into a filthy corridor, from the walls of
which&mdash;painted Heaven knows how!&mdash;oozes
a thick, slimy sweat.</p>

<p>They remain there herded for some time,
until another door opens. A gendarme counts
them off by the dozen, like fruit or cattle,
and hustles them into a large hall where
the Thing is to take place....</p>

<p>At once a sickening smell of man makes
them gasp. They cannot at first see very
clearly what all the movement going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
there is about. But they are left no time
to think.</p>

<p>What indeed is the good of thinking
at a time when an immense lamenting cry
escapes from the entire stricken nation&mdash;a
desperate call, the death-rattle of a drowning
people?</p>

<p>Why think? Does that frenzied, roaring
whirlwind which lays waste the old continent,
does <em>that</em> think? No, it is not indeed the
time for thought.</p>

<p>The men have to undress quickly and
fall in&mdash;in rows.</p>

<p>The hall is huge and forbidding. Its walls
are decorated with texts, and there are busts
of unknown men; in the centre a table, as
at a tribunal.</p>

<p>Some big-wig, white-haired and rather
arrogant, is enthroned there; he seems exhausted,
but pertinacious. He is assisted by
some obscure supernumeraries.</p>

<p>In front of the table, two doctors in white
overalls&mdash;one old and wizened, the other
still young, with a preoccupied, listless
look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>The men advance in single files towards
each of the doctors in white: they march one
behind the other like suppliants proceeding
to the altar of an angered God. They do not
know what to do with their arms.</p>

<p>They are not the flower of the race: for
a long time now the finest men in the land
have been living up to their waists in mud,
alert as cats to the dangers threatening
them. It is long since the farmer found anything
in his winnow except chaff and dust,
and it is there still that he searches with
an avaricious hand for a few scattered
grains.</p>

<p>The men are not cold: hot blasts of
air come rushing along the floor from a
blazing heating apparatus. Yet many of
the men shiver. Balancing sometimes on
one hip, sometimes on another, they fold
and unfold their arms, then drop them,
failing to strike any attitude. They are
ashamed of their nakedness.</p>

<p>In the corner, near the door, a gendarme
is pushing and hustling a thin, frail little
worker who is too slow in undressing: he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
thought he need not pull off his socks and
pants. He is forced to do so, however, and
he discloses two unwashed feet.</p>

<p>The men in overalls work with feverish
haste, like scene-shifters on the stage.</p>

<p>They ask short, succinct questions, and
at once they feel and press with their quickly
moving hands.</p>

<p>The victim is rather pale. A warm dew
comes out in beads on his temples. He
mumbles and speaks entreatingly. Then,
examined once again, he replies with more
assurance.</p>

<p>“You only suffer from that. Do you
cough?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are sure you suffer from palpitation
of the heart?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite sure, quite!”</p>

<p>“Then you have pain in talking?”</p>

<p>“Yes; that above all.”</p>

<p>“Your digestion is not good?”</p>

<p>“No; it never has been.”</p>

<p>The man seemed quite reassured. He
replied with a kind of enthusiasm&mdash;like some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
one who is at last understood. But, all at
once, the old doctor shrugs his shoulders and
reveals the trap:</p>

<p>“You’ve got everything wrong with you&mdash;that’s
quite clear. Well, you are classed
A1&mdash;the fighting line.”</p>

<p>“But surely you are aware&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You have too many illnesses; there’s
nothing wrong with you. Get out! The
fighting line for you!”</p>

<p>Sometimes somebody coughs, and at once
a storm of coughing breaks out among the
men gathered there.</p>

<p>A big grey-haired fellow comes out of
a dark corner. Everybody shrinks away
from him, with a kind of disgust. Then he
remonstrates with his neighbours:</p>

<p>“Hang it! D’you think that spots on
the skin....”</p>

<p>Behind him, collapsed almost on a bench,
a tall man who might be anything between
twenty and sixty years of age is carefully
undressing. His face makes you feel very
sorry for him: he seems plunged in the
depths of human despair. He takes off an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
incredible amount of clothing, knitted vests
and woollen things; and then there appear
some very touching articles: satchels, flannel
fronts, scapularies, objects of devotion. All
these he places on the bench. The men next
to him shift suddenly, and his clothes slip
on the floor and are trodden upon by those
who have just come in. The man is very
pale, as if people were trampling upon his
intimate life and his self-respect.</p>

<p>A discussion suddenly breaks upon the
silence. The old doctor was exclaiming in
a furious tone:</p>

<p>“I tell you I can hear nothing!”</p>

<p>With both hands he was pressing down
the shoulders of a poor weak wretch as thin
as a poker, and who looked terrified.</p>

<p>With one word the poor devil was ordered
into the fighting forces, and he went away,
more upset, trembling and panic-stricken than
he would ever be in the trenches in front of
the machine-guns.</p>

<p>But at the other end of the hall something
unusual was happening.</p>

<p>“I tell you I can walk,” protested a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
rasping voice, eaten away by goodness knows
what disease.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the young doctor, “no;
be reasonable, and go home. We’ll take you
later when you’ve recovered.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t want me, I shall do myself
in.... But I tell you I have reasons for
going to the front. I am not going to stand
any more insults day after day.”</p>

<p>A short silence takes possession of everyone
in the room: the echo of a tragedy is
felt. The man is obviously very ill. His
chest is horrible, distorted by violent breathing.
He can hardly stand on his swollen
legs, which are marked with large purple
veins.</p>

<p>“Rejected!” cries the judge.</p>

<p>And the unfortunate creature returns to
his rags, with lowered shoulders, his eyes dazed
like a bull that has been felled.</p>

<p>The man who followed was a fatalist: he
refused to discuss his position.</p>

<p>“That won’t prevent you serving.”</p>

<p>“Bah! just as you like.”</p>

<p>“Then, the fighting line!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“As you wish; I don’t care a damn.”</p>

<p>And he withdraws immediately, liberated
like a man who stakes his future on a mere
throw of the dice.</p>

<p>All those who go away leave behind them
something of the heavy smell of unwashed
bodies. Curious thing, they all have a fetid
breath; for that day they have eaten too
quickly, badly digested their food, smoked
and drunk too much. From all these mouths
comes the same warm, sour breath which
betrays the same emotion&mdash;the same breakdown
of the machine.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the room gradually
thickens. The lamps, which had been lit
quite early, appear to be lined with a heavy
clinging moisture that affects all the objects
in the room. But above all hovers something
more elusive and discordant&mdash;the air seems
to be charged with nervous energy, the
fragments of broken wills, the wreckage of
the thoughts abandoned there by men who
had to strip themselves naked, who were
afraid, who yearned and did not yearn,
who measured with anguish their powers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
resistance and the sacrifice they had to make,
who fought with all their might against the
forces of destiny.</p>

<p>The men in overalls continue to move
about among these human bodies. They
do not stop feeling, manipulating, judging.
They sink the ends of their fingers into the
flesh of the shoulders and sides; they press
the biceps with their thumb and middle finger,
move joints, examine teeth and the inside of
eyelids, pull hair, and tap chests as customs
officers do casks. Then they make the men
walk from left to right, and right to left.
They make them bend, straighten themselves,
kneel down, or expose the most secret parts
of their person.</p>

<p>Sometimes a breath of fresh air seems to
come into the room: two well-built young
men are asking to be enlisted. One hardly
understands why they are there.... The
whole tribunal looks at them with astonishment,
as at pieces of golden ore in a handful
of mud.</p>

<p>They pass with a proud, rather forced
smile. Again the procession begins of pathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
ugliness, terrors, despairs, incurable and ravaged
fears. The tribunal made one think
of a jagged cliff against which persons are
dashed like sea-birds blown by a storm.</p>

<p>The doctors show signs of exhaustion.
The oldest, who is rather deaf, throws himself
doggedly into his work, like a boar into the
thicket. The young doctor is obviously suffering
and irritated. He has the shrinking and
uneasy look of some one engaged in an odious
task and who finds no relief.</p>

<p>And always human flesh abounds; always
from the same corner of the room comes the
long row of wan bodies, who walk gingerly on
the floor.</p>

<p>Sacred human flesh, sacred substance
which serves thought, art, love, everything
great in life&mdash;it is now nothing but a vile, evil-smelling
lump of suet which one handles with
disgust to find whether it is yet ready for
the slaughter.</p>

<p>Everybody begins to suffer from an insistent
headache.</p>

<p>The work goes on as in a dream, with the
silences, the dragging movements, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
dark gaps of bad dreams. Two hours more
pass in this way. Then suddenly some one
says:</p>

<p>“Here are the last ten.”</p>

<p>They come in and undress one after the
other. They have waited so long they seem
exhausted, emptied, crushed. They accept
the verdict listlessly and mechanically, as if
felled by a blow; they go away in haste,
without speaking, without looking round.</p>

<p>The doctors wash their hands, as once did
Pontius Pilate; they sign some papers ceremoniously
and disappear.</p>

<p>Night has come. The wind has fallen.
A fog that absorbs the factory smoke still
hangs over the town. Leaning against a
lamp-post one of the last men examined
vomits, after excruciating efforts, the wine
he drank in the afternoon. The road is dark
and deserted.</p>

<p>The whole place reeks with the stench of
the vomiting and the fog.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">A BURIAL</h2>
</div>


<p>As we seated ourselves at the table
M. Gilbert asked:</p>

<p>“What time is Lieutenant Limberg’s
funeral?”</p>

<p>“Three o’clock, Doctor,” replied the
faithful Augustus; “an infantry platoon
will come from his own regiment, which is
at the moment leaving the firing line and is
billeted at Morcourt.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; send for Bénezech.”</p>

<p>And we began to enjoy the piquancy
of a cucumber salad. September was fading
slowly, but the furnace on the Somme was
getting ever fiercer. The roar of the cannon
seemed to fill the immensity of the heavens,
as if a great tragedy was happening in
the heart of the world. We were slightly
stupefied through having spent many nights
without sleep&mdash;nights passed in trying to
stem the torrent of blood, and save some of
the wreckage that swept down with it.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Limberg was one of the
saddest cases: for two weeks we tried to drag
him out of the swirling eddy, when, all of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
sudden, he sank rapidly, attacked by virulent
meningitis, stammering and uttering aloud
fantastic things, which gave his death a monstrous
atmosphere of comedy.</p>

<p>Nothing gives greater offence or greater
pain than to witness the torture and delirium
suffered by men injured in the brain. How
many times have I wished, when confronted
with these terrible sights, that our indifferent
rulers should be forced to look at them! But
it is useless insisting on this. If people have
no imagination, they can never learn. I had
better go on with my tale.</p>

<p>We were struggling with a tough piece of
beef when Bénezech came in.</p>

<p>The Abbé Bénezech, a second-grade
hospital orderly, combined various functions,
including those of a secretary and chaplain.
He was a plump, slow-witted man, with a
formidable jaw. He grew a large unkempt
beard, and he badly felt the want of those
cares and attentions which a devoted flock
had showered on him. Much too holy a
person to attach any importance to cares of
the toilette, he had gradually degenerated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
into a slovenly old man. But it was with
patience that he waited for his return to the
sweet amenities of his living.</p>

<p>“Bénezech,” said M. Gilbert, rather
familiarly, “what time do you bury
Lieutenant Limberg?”</p>

<p>“Three o’clock, sir.”</p>

<p>“The body has been taken out?”</p>

<p>“It should be in the mortuary shed.”</p>

<p>“Good! Was the lieutenant a Catholic?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; he most certainly was, sir.
Thank God! He took the sacrament yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Then everything is all right. Thank
you, Bénezech.”</p>

<p>The chaplain went out. Relapsing again
into our somnolent state, we returned to our
unappetising dish of vermicelli. As we were
finishing, an orderly came in and handed a
card to M. Gilbert.</p>

<p>“The officer,” he added, “insists on
seeing you at once.”</p>

<p>M. Gilbert repeatedly looked at the card
with the strained attention of a man who feels
he is falling asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! well,” he sighed; “show him in.”</p>

<p>And he added, turning towards us:</p>

<p>“Second Lieutenant David? Do you
know him? You don’t?”</p>

<p>The Second Lieutenant was already at
the door. Over his frizzly hair he wore the
small cap distinctive of the light infantry.
He had big lips, a faint, twisted moustache,
the magnificent dark eyes of a Jewish trader,
a hint of corpulence, short fat hands.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” he said, “my battalion is
going up the line, and I’m taking advantage
of my passing here to get permission to see
one of your patients&mdash;Lieutenant Limberg,
a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>M. Gilbert, who had rather an expressive
little nose, showed by a convulsive movement
of that organ that he was much
upset.</p>

<p>“Give the lieutenant a chair,” he began,
with the calm good sense of a man who
knows how to break bad news. Then he
proceeded:</p>

<p>“My dear friend, the news I have to
give you of Lieutenant Limberg is very sad:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
the unfortunate man had a serious wound
in the skull, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He is dead?” asked the officer, in a
strangled voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is dead. We are burying him
to-day at three o’clock.”</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant David remained for
some time without moving. A nervous twitch
began to work one side of his face. He
looked stunned, and wiped his temples, that
suddenly began to sweat profusely. We
showed our respect for this evident pain. In
a moment or two he got up, saluted, and was
about to take leave of us.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” he said, “he was my
best friend....”</p>

<p>In an absent way he gave each of us
his plump clammy hand to shake, and he
was going out, when he stopped on the
doorstep.</p>

<p>“One word more, Doctor. My friend
Limberg was a Jew&mdash;I am too&mdash;I thought it
was better to tell you....”</p>

<p>He was gone. A short silence intervened,
then M. Gilbert began to strike the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
with the handle of his knife&mdash;a succession of
rapid knocks.</p>

<p>“What did he say? Limberg a Jew?
It’s really too much! Call Bénezech.”</p>

<p>M. Gilbert was a stubborn, explosive
man, given to violent reactions. He seemed
to forget the heat, his exhaustion, and his
digestion. He began to throw little pellets
of bread-crumbs wildly all over the room.
He had the intense, expectant air of a cartridge
the fuse of which has been set alight.
Bénezech came to an abrupt stop at the door,
overwhelmed by the might of the doctor’s
vocal organs, which left no one in doubt as
to what he felt.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s you, is it? A fine mess you
were going to get me in!”</p>

<p>“Doctor!”</p>

<p>“Listen! Lieutenant Limberg was a
Jew, and you were going to give him a
Catholic funeral.”</p>

<p>“A Jew!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I say a Jew!”</p>

<p>The priest smiled, supremely incredulous.</p>

<p>“He was not a Jew, Doctor, because I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
administered the sacrament to him yesterday
again.”</p>

<p>M. Gilbert stopped short, like a horse who
shies at a wheelbarrow. Then he whispered
absently:</p>

<p>“Then you don’t believe a word I
say!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Doctor!” protested the priest, and
he raised his hands, the palms outwards, with
an unction that was surprising in a soldier
who arranged his putties so dapperly in
corkscrew fashion from his ankles.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may quite well have given him
the sacrament,” said M. Gilbert; “but what
did he have to say in the matter?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know what he could
say,” interrupted Augustus, “when, as you
know, for the last ten days he has been quite
delirious.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” remarked M. Gilbert.
“What have you got to say to that,
Bénezech?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think, Doctor;
but I can’t believe that a young man as
well educated as Lieutenant Limberg was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
not a Catholic. He took the sacrament twice
with me.”</p>

<p>“That may be; but did he tell you he
was a Catholic?”</p>

<p>“But, Doctor, how could I insult him by
asking him, especially when he was in such
a sad state. Besides, he came here wearing
crosses on his neck. I gave him several
myself, which he willingly took.”</p>

<p>“Evidently there is something wrong,”
said M. Gilbert. “You tell me that Limberg
was a Catholic; well, we have just been told
that he was Jewish. You had better send
first for the rabbi of the division. Then, to
make sure, send me a despatch-rider from
Limberg’s battalion. We shall find out from
them.”</p>

<p>Bénezech went out, raising his hands
several times, his fingers spread apart, looking
perplexed.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to the mortuary tent,” said
M. Gilbert, getting up from the table.</p>

<p>It was a disused tent where coffins were
placed on biers ready for burial services.</p>

<p>Wrapped in an old flag, Limberg’s coffin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
had been placed on two boxes. A ray of
sunlight broke obliquely across the shadow,
revealing a glittering swarm of mosquitos.
Some hens were pecking at the fine gravel.
This place of death seemed like a haven of
rest on the edge of the tempest of war.</p>

<p>An orderly came in, placed two candles
on the table, lit them, and stood a crucifix
between them.</p>

<p>“Damn!” muttered M. Gilbert between
his teeth; “it’s very tiresome, all this fuss.”</p>

<p>As we were coming out of the place,
we saw Bénezech and the despatch-rider.
Bénezech’s beard seemed to bristle with
triumph. With his fingers on his <em>képi</em>, he
saluted as if he were pronouncing the benediction,
and he said in a celestial voice:</p>

<p>“Information from the battalion, Doctor:
Lieutenant Limberg was a Catholic.”</p>

<p>“Confound it all!” cried the doctor.
“Have you a written note?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the cyclist. “The officers
only discussed the matter among themselves,
and they said he was a Catholic. You
will see them yourself presently: they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
coming to the funeral with the infantry
platoon.”</p>

<p>M. Gilbert stamped on the ground. He
was very red, and the unruly movements
of his nose showed that a decision was about
to be made.</p>

<p>“Can I get ready for the service?” asked
Bénezech, with the innocent and measured
tone of a man who does not press home his
victory.</p>

<p>“What!” said M. Gilbert. “The service?
As you please&mdash;get ready as much as you like.
I have my own idea now.”</p>

<p>Our devoted Augustus, who had left us
for a few minutes, came back with a packet
of envelopes.</p>

<p>“I have been looking into the private
correspondence of the lieutenant. I find
nothing conclusive, except perhaps this postcard,
signed by a Mr. Blumenthal, who calls
Lieutenant Limberg ‘his cousin.’ Blumenthal&mdash;that’s
a Jewish name.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so,” said M. Gilbert; “but I
don’t mind now. I have my own idea.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Augustus hesitatingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
“that you could still&mdash;have the coffin
opened.”</p>

<p>“No! you mustn’t think of it!” M. Gilbert
firmly replied; “and I repeat, I have my own
idea. Let’s go back to our work.”</p>

<p>We returned then to work; and that
lasted about two and a half hours. Then the
orderly reappeared.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, the Jewish chaplain wants to
see you.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming,” he said.</p>

<p>He put on his four-striped <em>képi</em>, took off
his overalls, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Looking through the window, I saw the
rabbi of the division arriving. He got out
of a pedlar’s cart drawn by a crook-kneed
mule. With his black skull-cap, his flowing
beard, his long coat, his cross-hilted stick, his
tall bent figure in the distance, he seemed to
me like the Polish Jews one reads of in popular
novels. He appeared a man of mature age,
and got off the step with the dignity of a
patriarch.</p>

<p>My curiosity was aroused, and I went out
to see what was going to happen. Twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
steps from the cart, in the bend of an avenue,
I again saw the rabbi, without at first recognising
him: his beard was black, rather frizzly,
he had a very slight tendency to corpulence,
his smile was that of an Assyrian god, and
there was something in his looks of the Eastern
calm of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>I skirted a shed and found myself face
to face with the doctor and the Jewish
chaplain. I saw at once that I had been
twice mistaken. He was a man of the world,
not old at all, wearing pince-nez, with a
studious, attentive appearance, aloof and
erudite&mdash;the “distinguished” air of a university
graduate. He spoke the rather cosmopolitan
French of a man who knows six
or seven languages, but who has not perfectly
mastered the correct accent of any of them.</p>

<p>“Really, Doctor,” he was saying, “we
have many Limbergs in the East. I know
several families.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you do,” replied M. Gilbert
courteously. “But I have finally decided
what to do. Will you come along now,
sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>We walked slowly to the tent. As we
got near, the ground vibrated with the rapid
tread of a small company on the march,
and the infantry platoon appeared. Some
officers followed, a little distance off.</p>

<p>Everybody stopped before the tent, and
we saw Bénezech coming out. Over his
jacket he had thrown an ancient surplice,
which seemed to have seen service not only
in the present war, but in every war of the
past century.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said the doctor rather
emphatically, “an unfortunate thing has
happened. We cannot tell with certainty
what was Lieutenant Limberg’s religion. The
information you have sent us would tend to
show he was Catholic.”</p>

<p>“A practising Catholic,” added Bénezech,
taking advantage of a pause.</p>

<p>“May I ask you,” continued the doctor,
“on what you base your judgment?”</p>

<p>The officers looked at one another, as if
they had been caught unawares.</p>

<p>“Why!” said one of them, “he never told
us he was a Jew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! I have definite evidence,” said a
captain: “he went to Mass several times
with me.”</p>

<p>“But, hang it!” said M. Gilbert to this
obtuse soldier, “that proves nothing. Why!
I go myself to Mass sometimes.... It’s
true,” he added, “I’m not a Jew. As for
Limberg: to-day I saw one of his intimate
friends, who informed me that the lieutenant
held the Jewish faith.”</p>

<p>Another pause intervened. The soldiers
had piled arms in the avenue. All present
seemed perplexed and hesitating. The two
priests had not looked at one another yet,
and seemed to be examining the uniform of
the officers with the greatest care.</p>

<p>At that moment two stretcher-bearers
came out of the tent carrying the coffin
draped with the French colours. They took
three paces forward, and the priest and the
rabbi found themselves suddenly one on each
side of the corpse.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said the doctor, in a voice a
prophet would use when thinking of Solomon&mdash;“gentlemen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
because of the uncertainty,
I have decided that Lieutenant Limberg
shall be buried according to the rites both
of the Roman Catholic and of the Hebrew
Church. There will then be no possibility of
a mistake being made; at most, one superfluous
service. We know that God recognises
his own. These gentlemen will proceed in
turn. I believe I am doing a wise and just
thing.”</p>

<p>The officers nodded their heads, without
betraying what they thought. The two
priests, for the first time, looked at one
another. They looked at each other over
the coffin, and bowed as if they had only
just arrived. Moved by the same impulse,
they both affected a curious smile; but
their eyes had no share in it. They confronted
each other like two members of a family
who have a feud of centuries behind them,
and who meet in the presence of a man of
the world.</p>

<p>Between them, the stake was, not a soul,
but a box containing a stiff body, distorted
by a death-agony of ten days&mdash;a box wrapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
in a symbolic shroud which a light breeze
ruffled.</p>

<p>The two priests looked at one another
with interest for one long moment. On
one side, the country priest, with an ungainly
peasant build: on the other the cultured and
cosmopolitan rabbi, with the sophisticated
smile, old as the Bible.</p>

<p>“Really,” whispered Augustus in my
ear&mdash;“really, Bénezech has done it often
enough in his time; he might let the other
have a chance.”</p>

<p>“You be quiet!” said M. Gilbert, who
had overheard him. “You are a fool to talk
like that. This is no laughing matter.”</p>

<p>Bénezech was just very slightly shrugging
his shoulders; he lowered his eyes and
stammered:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, if Lieutenant Limberg was
really of the Hebrew faith, I would prefer to
withdraw.”</p>

<p>“Do as you think best, Bénezech,” said
M. Gilbert.</p>

<p>The rabbi continued to smile. He had
the patient look of a believer who knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
that the Messiah once failed to appear at the
appointed time, and that one must continue
to expect him for thousands of years again.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Bénezech, quite low, “I
withdraw, Doctor.”</p>

<p>He made a few steps, and we heard him
murmur as he withdrew:</p>

<p>“The chief thing is that he should receive
the sacrament. And he has&mdash;twice.”</p>

<p>The rabbi was still smiling, as if he was
thinking: “As for me, I remain.”</p>

<p>M. Gilbert made a sign. Commands rang
out, and everybody stood at the salute.</p>

<p>No, my dear fellow, the war hasn’t
changed everybody.</p>

<p>You didn’t know M. Perrier-Langlade?</p>

<p>He was what we should call a great
organiser&mdash;a man who might, for instance,
hit upon a spot where everything was going
on all right, and everyone knew his job and
was busy at it. But to M. Perrier-Langlade,
who had very original views as to what was
practical, everything was going quite wrong.
Objects had at once to be moved from their
places and jobs had to be exchanged. He
walked with a stick in his right hand&mdash;<em>his</em>
working tool&mdash;which he waved like a fencer
or an orchestral conductor: he tapped everybody
with this annoying stick, and commands
fell from him like hail from a cloud. One
works-section which his genius had reorganised
was several weeks before it could
be set going again with anything like its old
smoothness. M. Perrier-Langlade had ideas:
and that is an event of momentous importance.
For ordinary mortals, you know, can never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
pretend to ideas: these are the preserve
of the great. And the height of M. Perrier-Langlade’s
ingenuity was to think that the
suggestions we had all been wanting to
work out were entirely his own. But that
again did not lead to efficiency; for this rare
mind was ever open to the latest thing in
ideas&mdash;showing, let us admit, a very generous
disposition. He bent to every gust of wind.
He was indeed so unpractical that his sense of
the relation between thought and action was of
the haziest. But that of course is the penalty
of an exalted position, and in other respects
M. Perrier-Langlade was a great organiser.</p>

<p>He loved figures. Let us do him this
justice: he handled them with the freedom of
an expert. He saw in them a deep meaning
which always escaped our unmathematical
minds.</p>

<p>M. Perrier-Langlade I had only seen
from a distance&mdash;and on rare occasions;
but at last I was to talk to him. What am
I saying!&mdash;I am presuming a great deal: you
know what my rank is&mdash;well, then, I was
at last to be admitted to the presence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
M. Perrier-Langlade, to hear him discourse,
to profit by the kind of education which the
most insignificant of his utterances and movements
were able to bestow.</p>

<p>It occurred last winter, during the weeks
of intense cold. For a fortnight it had been
blowing&mdash;a sharp, despairing, cold east wind.</p>

<p>The cold and the wind had given rise to
an epidemic of fires on the front. The little
stoves had been stuffed to their fullest capacity,
and they crackled and smoked convulsively,
and the corners of sheds sometimes
caught their fever. A flame stuck its nose
outside: the wind snapped at it, twisted,
stretched it, swelled it like a sail, and most
often it cost five or six thousand francs in
wood, paper, canvas, and other materials.
When the Germans saw it happening within
gunshot distance, they despatched a few
explosives with the charitable object of
helping on its sinister designs. It’s what you
must expect, you know. You either make or
you don’t make war. And the miserable
world has made it&mdash;there’s no shadow of
doubt about that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>We had lost in this way many huts,
which were happily cut off from the others,
and it had been a useful warning to us when,
one night, about one o’clock, a fire&mdash;a terrible
fire&mdash;broke out in Hut 521, which could be
seen on the plain three or four miles away
from us.</p>

<p>We had just put on our boots and had
gone out to watch it. What a sight it was!
The huge furnace with its tongues of flame,
the bluish country benumbed with frost, the
wind which seemed to ripple like water in the
moonlight, and the reflections of the fire on
the Siberian landscape, honeycombed with
the old trenches of 1915.</p>

<p>We were horrified at the thought of what
was happening there; but we did not dare
to leave our post.</p>

<p>And we did right; for towards 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> a
long line of motors came hooting before the
door&mdash;some of the wounded rescued from the
fire were being brought to us.</p>

<p>We got them out of the cars. How
patient they were, poor things! Two with
fractured skulls, one with an amputated leg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
and another with a broken leg, and several
less seriously wounded. They had lost in
the fire all the possessions which, as soldiers,
they were allowed to have&mdash;the linen bag
you see hanging on the bed, containing a
knife, a box of matches, three or four old
letters, and a small lead pencil. I repeat,
they did behave well; but they were pitiful
to look at. They really looked like people
who for one awful moment had lain helpless
in their beds while the flames surrounded
them, and who were conscious of only one
agonising thought: “If help doesn’t come
at once, in five minutes it will be too late.”</p>

<p>We put them into bed, and got them
warm again: they needed it. I well remember
seeing icicles glistening on the bandages
of the man with the broken leg. It was
a sorry business. The whole night long we
looked after them; and only in the morning
were we able to chat round the coffee-pot.
The wounded were dozing. The hut was
almost warm. We had made them wear
cotton caps and woollen vests, and drink
a cupful of boiling milk. They were in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
half-dozing, half-waking state and seemed
to be thinking: “Lord! what a narrow
shave! And it’s the second one too. We
had better look out for the third.”</p>

<p>It was then, old fellow, that M. Perrier-Langlade
arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>I had gone out&mdash;I don’t remember why&mdash;and
I was kicking my heels on the frosty ground,
when I saw a sumptuous motor-car come to
a stop on the road. The door clicked open,
and M. Perrier-Langlade came out, staggering
under a heavy, luxurious fur cloak.</p>

<p>I at once thought: “Ah, good! Here’s
M. Perrier-Langlade coming to cheer up my
poor patients.”</p>

<p>I had a hundred yards to cover. I leaped
over some dizzy gratings, and I arrived,
rather out of breath, just in time to spring
to attention before the door. M. Perrier-Langlade
stamped with annoyance.</p>

<p>“What!” he said to me. “There is no
one here to receive me!”</p>

<p>“I ask your pardon, Monsieur&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue! You can see for
yourself there is no one here. You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
to-night taken in some of the wounded from
Hut 521. I went to see the fire myself&mdash;at
two o’clock in the morning&mdash;risking an attack
of pneumonia. I’m not bothering about that,
though; but it is my wish that some one
should be here to receive me&mdash;here&mdash;when I
come out of the car. If you hadn’t come
there would have been no one, and I will
not be kept waiting these very cold days.
In future you will have an orderly permanently
stationed here.”</p>

<p>“But you understand, Monsieur&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue! How many
wounded did you take in to-night?”</p>

<p>“Thirteen, Monsieur. It is true that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Enough! Thirteen! Thirteen!”</p>

<p>M. Perrier-Langlade began to repeat the
number, presumably for his own benefit.
It was quite clear that this number suggested
to his mind thoughts of a deep and wide
significance. I don’t know what foolish impulse
made me then open my mouth.</p>

<p>“But note, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Be quiet!” he said angrily. “Thirteen!
Thirteen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>I felt extremely confused and took refuge
in complete silence. That didn’t last long.
Ravier was approaching as fast as his legs
could carry him: he had seen the motor,
and had galloped.... He stopped dead at
five paces, his two heels stuck in the
crunching snow, and saluted.</p>

<p>“There you are,” remarked M. Perrier-Langlade&mdash;“not
too soon either. How many
wounded have you taken in to-night that
you wouldn’t have ordinarily?”</p>

<p>Ravier gave me a despairing look. I
showed him my open hand, holding apart
my fingers, and Ravier, in spite of his discomfiture,
replied:</p>

<p>“Five, sir.”</p>

<p>“Five! Five!” said M. Perrier-Langlade.
“Then it is not thirteen, but five!”</p>

<p>I jumped as if some one had stuck a hatpin
in me.</p>

<p>“But note, sir, that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue!” he said, with an
authoritative calm. “Five! Five!”</p>

<p>And he began to repeat this word, with an
air that was at once Olympian and indulgent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
like some one who cannot reproach men
who are too ignorant to enjoy the supreme
delights of arithmetic.</p>

<p>We looked at one another, astounded,
when we heard the tread of a pair of hobnailed
boots, and M. Mourgue appeared, his nose
blue with cold, his little beard quite stiff,
and emitting, as he panted, a cloud of steam.</p>

<p>“Ah! at last!” cried M. Perrier-Langlade.
“Here you are, Monsieur Mourgue. Will you
be good enough to tell me how many men
you have at present in your huts?”</p>

<p>M. Mourgue appeared to sink into himself
before replying, in a preoccupied tone:</p>

<p>“Twenty-eight, sir.”</p>

<p>M. Perrier-Langlade this time laughed a
bitter, discouraged laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, well! it is not thirteen, nor five,
but twenty-eight! Twenty-eight! And I
was suspecting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, sir&mdash;&mdash;” we cried all together excitedly.</p>

<p>From beneath the cloak of fur he thrust
out his hand, which, in spite of its velvet
glove, was none the less a mailed fist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“Be silent, gentlemen! You do not
understand. Twenty-eight!”</p>

<p>We looked at each other as if we had suddenly
gone mad. M. Perrier-Langlade, carried
away by sublime meditation, walked to and fro
repeating, “Twenty-eight! Twenty-eight!”</p>

<p>I noticed his voice had almost a provincial
inflection, and was not without geniality. For
a few moments he repeated, first shaking
his head, then with increasing joy, “Twenty-eight!
Twenty-eight!” And I was convinced
that to him figures did not mean the
same thing as they do to you or me.</p>

<p>Then he abruptly saluted, with a supreme,
imperious courtesy.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, gentlemen! Twenty-eight!
Twenty-eight!”</p>

<p>And he went off to his car, rubbing his
hands together, with the savage joy of a
man who has got hold of some absolute
truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">DISCIPLINE</h2>
</div>


<p>Frankly, I do not regret those four
days’ imprisonment. True, they cost
me a terrific cold&mdash;and perhaps I
may here be allowed to say that the guard-room
was anything but clean&mdash;still, I learnt
some very useful things. Indeed, I can hardly
cry out against the injustice of it in view of
the inestimable benefit I received and the
insight it gave me. No, I am not sorry for
having experienced, at the age of forty-six,
the straw of the prison cell that every one
admits to be damp and unhealthy.</p>

<p>When the sergeant, who is not at all a
bad fellow, though afflicted with a painful
disease, came and told me, “Monsieur Bouin,
you’ve got four days guard-room,” I was
at first amazed and incredulous. At the
same time, it was early in the day, and the
sergeant, who never joked before his morning
operation, added with a doleful expression:</p>

<p>“Some one named Bouin ought to have
been on duty last night in the hospital.
But no one turned up. It wasn’t perhaps
you, my poor Monsieur Bouin, who cut your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
job, but it’s certainly you who have four
days’ imprisonment.”</p>

<p>The sergeant stopped. I felt something
gripping me in the pit of the stomach, and a
heavy blush added to my discomfort. Right
up to the first weeks of the war, my life had
been peaceful and happy: there were some
emotions I had not until then experienced,
and I could not get accustomed to them, so
that I was acutely conscious of the indignity
I now had to suffer.</p>

<p>“Sergeant,” I said, “it can’t be true. I
was on hospital duty the day before yesterday,
and I am to-morrow again. It wasn’t my
turn last night, I am quite certain.”</p>

<p>I must have been very red and trembling,
for the sergeant looked at me for a moment
or two, evidently feeling very sorry. Then
he said, “Just wait a moment. I’ll go and
see the orderly officer”; and he went out.</p>

<p>I went back to my scrubbing. That is
very tiring work for a man who has spent
his life studying mathematics; but in September
1914 a spirit of determination and of
sacrifice had aroused all Frenchmen worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
of the name. I had volunteered to serve
my country humbly, proudly, within the extreme
limits of my strength; and as it was
upon my physical strength that the demand
was chiefly being made, I used every day to
scrub the floor with enthusiasm. On that
morning I threw myself frantically into the
job, with such a will indeed that heavy drops
of perspiration undid my work. I suffered,
but was quite content: we water our native
soil with what we can. Don’t you think so?</p>

<p>The sergeant came back.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Bouin,” he said, “it’s you
all right. You’ve got four days’ clink, and
it’s a dirty trick they are playing on you.
Quite lately a doctor joined up who has the
same name as yours, but he hasn’t yet been
given his rank. As he does the work of a
major, he hasn’t to stick it on night duty.
But the clerks, who never know anything,
put him down for duty, and that’s how no
one turned up. You understand? Then
the colonel ordered four days’ imprisonment.
But the orderly officer got him to
see that he couldn’t punish the doctor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
who’s got his job to do! But you see the
punishment has been posted under the name
Bouin; and as some one has got to be
punished, I suppose it’s got to be you....”</p>

<p>I was holding one of those scrubbing-sticks
at the end of which a piece of wax
was usually fixed. I was so astounded that
I let the thing fall. The clumsy clatter
seemed to be cruelly emphasised by the
echoing walls of the room. It sounded like
a smack. I felt so wretched.</p>

<p>“Go yourself and see the officer,” said
the sergeant, rather touched, shifting from
one leg to the other. “I have now to see
about the signatures....”</p>

<p>I let him go; for when this good fellow
talks of signatures, he is tortured by a very
necessary need, which he cannot satisfy
without suffering those shooting pains....</p>

<p>I placed my scrubbing implements in a
corner, and I hastened to the office, buttoning
my little jacket with trembling fingers: my
equanimity was never real, and I felt some
difficulty in controlling my emotions.</p>

<p>I knew the officer: he was an old Alsatian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
whom the war had dragged out of a <em>mairie</em>
where he was spending the days of his retirement.
He had not, up till then, appeared
to me a difficult person, nor needlessly fussy;
and I did not despair of being able to make
him unbend and to acknowledge himself in
the wrong.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s you, Bouin,” he said coolly.
“Well, you’ve got to do four days’ imprisonment.
You begin at noon.”</p>

<p>“But, sir,” I said, “while my name is
Bouin&mdash;Bouin, Léon&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He cut me short.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter what your Christian
name is. There was no Christian name on
the list. You have seen the name Bouin:
you’ve only got to carry out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But, sir, the times I go on duty have
been definitely fixed for the last two weeks.
I haven’t noticed&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The man jumped to his feet, and I saw
he was short&mdash;almost ridiculously short. He
came towards me angrily, sputtering into his
moustache.</p>

<p>“A punishment has been ordered. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
one has got to take it; and it’s you who’ve
got to do so. What is your profession?”</p>

<p>“A teacher of mathematics, and a
volunteer.”</p>

<p>He added in a tense voice:</p>

<p>“It doesn’t follow that because you are
not a conscript you’re going to be cock of
the walk here. Besides, men of education
like yourself ought to be an example to the
others. Follow my advice, and do your four
days, my boy.”</p>

<p>“But, <em>Monsieur l’officier</em>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You do as I advise you. This is not
the moment, when the enemy is hammering
at the gates of the capital&mdash;this is not the
moment, I repeat, to scatter germs of indiscipline.”</p>

<p>“But, sir, discipline&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Lines appeared on his brow and round
his mouth. Then he muttered in a tone
that was at once arrogant, sad and sententious:</p>

<p>“Discipline!&mdash;why, you don’t know what
it is! You can’t teach me anything about
that. Do your four days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>I understood from the gesture accompanying
these words that I must depart. An
unexpected reply escaped me.</p>

<p>“Sir,” I said, “I shall send in a complaint
to the colonel.”</p>

<p>The dwarf brought down his fists on a pile
of documents.</p>

<p>“Good! good! Another row! And we
think we are going to win with such people!
Get out of my sight, will you!”</p>

<p>I thought he groaned, and I found myself
in the passage. Midway between the floor
and the ceiling ran a water-pipe, making a
babbling noise. It seemed to have been
installed there in the silence since the days
of Adam.</p>

<p>I went staggering back to my work.</p>

<p>The doctor of the third division at that
time was a man named Briavoine. What a
delightful and sympathetic person he was!
He had such a jolly way of feeling convinced
about everything he said. And how I loved
to see him smile, with the wrinkles on his
wide bare forehead and round his eyes!</p>

<p>M. Briavoine was in his office when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
arrived; but on that day no smile lit up
his face, which was frowning and majestic.</p>

<p>“No, no!” he was saying to those
around him. “Dufrêne is a general, but I&mdash;I
am mere Briavoine.”</p>

<p>A silence full of respect greeted this firm
avowal. The reputation of M. Briavoine was
more than European. He had distinguished
himself in the delicate art of making childbirth
a less difficult and painful process, and
many princesses had benefited by his care.</p>

<p>I was so obsessed with my little affair that
I began to wander over the room without any
real or apparent aim; and, in doing so, I very
clumsily knocked up against M. Briavoine.</p>

<p>“Be careful, my friend,” said this kind
and courteous man.</p>

<p>The urbanity of M. Briavoine, the gentleness
of his voice, his correct and exquisite
gesture, soothed my violated self-respect.
I retired gratefully and with modesty to a
corner where papers were being classified.
And I thought: “How very polite he is,
from every point of view!...”</p>

<p>Gradually I regained my equanimity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
took an interest in the conversation of the
officers&mdash;an interest which soon became very
keen.</p>

<p>They were expecting, that very day, a
visit from the Chief of the Medical Staff of
the Forces&mdash;General Dufrêne. The imperious
and diligent visits which this weighty person
paid to the armies were worthy of the highest
praise, and were, too, occasions for keen
criticism.</p>

<p>M. Briavoine took off his braided tunic:
gold and silver stripes adorned the sleeves.</p>

<p>“Give me my overalls,” he said. “Monsieur
Dufrêne wishes to be received by his
subordinates in full-dress uniform; but the
needs of our profession require a coat like
this.”</p>

<p>A breath of rebellion disturbed the atmosphere.
Those standing round M. Briavoine
were understood to murmur their assent, in
which there was at once something of bitterness,
irony and defiance. Dressed in white,
the great doctor looked at himself contentedly.</p>

<p>“I am going to receive Dufrêne,” he said,
“as I am now, in overalls, without my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
<em>képi</em>; if he takes it into his head to object,
he may find that though I may be a subordinate,
I am a man who has a right to
some independence. That I serve my country
disinterestedly no one can dispute, and I am
not going to be lorded over. What have I to
gain? My work in civil life is worth all the
honours that I could ever get here.”</p>

<p>These sensible views were hardly uttered
before Professor Proby came in. He was a
very tall man, with straw-coloured hair, and
a look that expressed a seriousness bordering
on stupidity. He used to bawl in talking,
cutting up his sentences with all kinds of
interjections and expletives which completely
altered the sense of what he wanted to say.
He plunged into a conversation with as much
good manners as a buffalo.</p>

<p>“What! What are you telling me?
But I don’t care a hang.... Him! Why
he knows quite well that&mdash;what! I am
Paul Proby! And I am a member of the
Academy; and I....”</p>

<p>It was true: Professor Proby honoured
the Academy with his contributions. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
beat his foot on the ground, jingling his
glittering spurs, and the rather showy parts
of an accoutrement that had remained unused
in a cupboard until the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>“Dufrêne! that man!” he said again.
“I’ve always been on good terms with him.
But one mustn’t ... how annoying it is ...
that man!”</p>

<p>M. Briavoine, who had tact, thought the
conversation was getting incoherent. With
one turn of the rudder, he brought the ship
back to its course.</p>

<p>“It’s not a question of personalities, but
a question of principle. We are not, like
our enemies, a race that has been brutally
enslaved....”</p>

<p>This generalisation seemed to bring an
atmosphere of philosophy into the sunlit
room. Everybody began to listen attentively,
and the spirit of revolt became measured and
serious.</p>

<p>Since my interview with the orderly
officer, one single word leaped and danced
in my head. I repeated it mechanically. I
dissected its syllables, obsessed and anxious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly I felt that the word was going to
be uttered; that it was ripe, fertile, bursting;
that it was going to spring out of my head&mdash;escape&mdash;and
alight, in turn, on every mouth
that was speaking there.</p>

<p>“You cannot,” said M. Briavoine, “ask
Frenchmen to accept without question an
authority that has no bounds. I will even
admit without any shame that our race is
the least disciplined in the world.”</p>

<p>“Authority, like alcohol, is a poison
which makes man mad,” said a spectacled
young man with sharp looks.</p>

<p>“I thoroughly agree,” cried the doctor.
“As for discipline....”</p>

<p>A sigh of satisfaction escaped me. It
was done. The word had come out, and I
saw it disporting itself outside of me with a
feeling at once of deliverance and curiosity.
I gazed at the celebrated doctor with a very
real gratitude. My satisfaction was indeed
so great that in spite of my low rank I
vigorously nodded to show how completely
I agreed with Dr. Briavoine. And approval
being always acceptable from any one however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
insignificant, Dr. Briavoine gave me in
passing one of those generous smiles of
his that were half-hidden away in his
beard.</p>

<p>“Discipline,” he was saying, “is not perhaps
a French virtue. But, God be praised!
we have others; and our critical spirit alone,
so subtle, incisive and delicate, is worth all
the heavy qualities of our enemies.”</p>

<p>Doctor Coupé had come in almost unseen
in the midst of the general interest. Taken
to task by his colleagues, this excellent old
man looked like a late-season leaf which
the storm was trying to tear away from
a bough. For a few seconds he hesitated
between his innate terror of authority and
his love of mischief. The vehemence of the
views, however, that prevailed left him no
option; and the dry leaf sped away, swirling
in the gale.</p>

<p>“We are ready to shed our blood, if
we are called upon,” the doctor said, stating
a principle; “but, in God’s name! they should
ask us politely.”</p>

<p>“The very least! Manners!” muttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Professor Proby. “I am disciplined enough&mdash;on
condition ... what?... We ask for
some consideration.”</p>

<p>“You know what Dufrêne did, the day
before yesterday?” ventured an important-looking
person, who was trying by a clever
adjustment of his collar and movement of
his chin to keep his beard in a horizontal
position, and who acquired in this way
an air of extraordinary majesty. “Listen
then....” And in the middle of a chorus
of protestations and laughter he began to
tell the latest little scandal invented by
imaginations which are not content with the
reading of the communiqués of those glorious
and tragic days.</p>

<p>There were about a dozen doctors in the
room. Four or five were indeed princes
among doctors. The war had given me a
unique opportunity of knowing these distinguished
personalities, and I assure you
I felt a not unnatural emotion in hearing
them speak freely before me. My conversation
of the morning with my orderly officer
had very much upset me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Mathematics impose on the mind stubborn
habits of order. I am unfortunately a bachelor,
but I have quite rational, serious views on
the family and society, as you would expect
from my tastes and my profession. I know
that very learned mathematicians have been
able to imagine triangles which did not have
three sides, or parallel lines which ended in
meeting in a point.... I cannot follow
these masters on such a path: perhaps I
am too old to follow such tracks. Anyhow,
I am satisfied with what I do know. When
looking at my library, and turning over the
pages of my lecture note-books, I always
experienced a pleasant sensation of order
and discipline. Besides, the study of mathematics
makes you logical. And what had
happened to me that morning was not
logical&mdash;in other words, was not just. And
the thought that the demands of order
required an illogical action even in the
midst of the chaos of war, appeared to me
the wildest incoherence.</p>

<p>You can then imagine the relief, even
enthusiasm, I felt on hearing these eminent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
men justify my rebellious attitude. I listened
to their words, marking them with approving
nods of the head. I felt a keen, almost
trembling enjoyment, mingled with pride and
a kind of superstitious terror.</p>

<p>Gradually I became aware that the last
emotion was becoming the dominant one.
I feared I was relying too much on reason;
without knowing my position, these gentlemen
were too excited and earnest in their
approval. This verbal exaltation of indiscipline
made me feel an exquisite uneasiness,
almost of pain. Forced to be quiet out
of respect, I nevertheless mentally and repeatedly
begged them to be calm: “Take
care, gentlemen! Be calm, sirs!”</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts when, in the
general uproar of voices, a bell was heard
ringing: it was the visitors’ office bell.
Immediately the room was strangely quiet.</p>

<p>“<em>Monsieur le principal!</em>” said a sergeant
who had just appeared at the door; “the
motor-car of the Chief of the Medical Staff
is at the gate.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” said some one whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
everybody called familiarly Father Coupé.
Then automatically he adjusted his <em>képi</em> on
his head, and stepped towards the door.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Professor
Proby in a voice that was arrogant yet without
much self-assurance.</p>

<p>“I’m going to receive him at the
entrance,” replied the old fellow.</p>

<p>“What! There are other people for
that. We can wait for him here while we
work.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think of it,” said M.
Coupé. “The custom&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, I used to call that fellow Dufrêne,
without the Mr., in civil life,” muttered
Professor Proby. “And I contend that ...
ha! the idea!”</p>

<p>“It’s a question of courtesy,” commented
M. Briavoine. “Let’s go to the door. Give
me my tunic.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish to keep on your overalls,
my dear master?” said the young man with
the sharp look.</p>

<p>“Of course. But I’m afraid of catching
cold. Give me my <em>képi</em> as well; I can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
walk across the garden with nothing on my
head.”</p>

<p>M. Briavoine turned towards me.</p>

<p>“My friend,” he said, “look for the
registers, and be so good as to come along
with me.”</p>

<p>Then he repeated, putting on his hat:</p>

<p>“There is no point in catching cold.”</p>

<p>A warm ray of sunlight entered by the
open window! I thought M. Briavoine had
no reason to fear colds, and I took the
registers.</p>

<p>The group of officers were now going
down the wide stairs, in a tumult of voices
and footsteps.</p>

<p>A feeling of uneasiness, it seemed to me,
gave a slight chill to the conversation. As
we arrived under the arches, I heard M.
Briavoine saying to M. Coupé:</p>

<p>“It’s the first time, since the war, that
I meet the Chief of the Medical Staff, General
Dufrêne.”</p>

<p>He added, not without a certain gravity
of tone:</p>

<p>“Vernier, go back and see if they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
swept the subalterns’ room. Some cotton was
lying about there just now.”</p>

<p>“Hang it!” mumbled Proby; “he must
not come and interfere with us. And he’s
going to be received like this! We’ll tell
him&mdash;what!&mdash;we’ll tell him a thing or two.”</p>

<p>“We will tell him, right enough,” said
M. Briavoine with decision. “We’ll tell him
that the hospital is badly lighted; the gas-pipes
and water-pipes are innumerable; that
the food is not as it should be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I shall not stick at anything,” interrupted
Father Coupé: “I shall insist on the important
improvements I want for my work.”</p>

<p>As we got to the steps of the entrance,
Professor Proby became suddenly irascible,
and, taking on one side one of the attendants
who was wearing a white coat, said to him:</p>

<p>“You, there! Get yourself into uniform.
It looks better.”</p>

<p>The motor-car of the Chief of the Medical
Staff was coming to a stop in front of the
door. It opened like a dry fruit, and shot out
its contents on the pavement.</p>

<p>What an impressive personage! He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
tall and, it seemed to me, of enormous
proportions. A typically military face&mdash;no
one could mistake it&mdash;deep features over
which the fingers and the nails of the sculptor
must have passed again and again; on the
nose, too, the sculptor’s thumb must have
been at work, pressing and moulding delicately
the lumps of flesh; a bristling white
moustache and imperial, of the kind specially
reserved for soldiers advanced in age. He
wore an old general’s uniform, which many
give up with the greatest difficulty, like
old ideas. Gold, jewellery, velvet, and silk
facings adorned his body with such refulgence
that the imagination could hardly conceive
that, beneath this barbarous splendour, there
were lungs, muscles, bones and a shrivelled
skin covered with grey hair.</p>

<p>A look escaped from beneath his bushy eyebrows,
which was at once violent, questioning,
and suggestive of unutterable pride.</p>

<p>He came forward in grave silence.</p>

<p>I expected a scene; but from that
moment what took place has remained
mysteriously veiled in my memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>In one single movement everybody there
took up a certain position, and they made
a correct military salute according to the
rules taught so patiently in barracks to
recruits from the country.</p>

<p>Faces imperceptibly became rigid. The
light in one’s eyes became dull and fixed.
Ten centuries of a habit imposed and accepted
petrified tongues, muscles and minds.</p>

<p>Some thistleseed flew away with the
breeze. As I saw it fluttering, white, woolly,
without weight, I thought&mdash;I don’t know
why&mdash;of that subtle, fine, delicate, critical
spirit. It vanished in a gust of wind. A
big insect loaded with pollen could be heard
buzzing around.</p>

<p>I felt stupid! A long pause; then the
white-moustached gentleman decided to let
these words fall from his lips:</p>

<p>“Good-day, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>The visit began in the rooms which had
been packed with the wounded from the
Marne front. There young men were lying
who had been face to face with War, and
who had calmly recognised it as the old Devil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
of the Species. From that time they spoke
of it just as they always will, now that three
years of blood, suffering and torture have
decimated, maimed and broken them.</p>

<p>But nobody bothered about their thoughts.
Sheets were drawn back, bandages were
undone, wounds were left open to the air.
It was now a question of “cases” and of
lesions.</p>

<p>A scientific discussion was commencing,
to which I listened with an eager curiosity.
As I have said, doctors were present who
were princes in their profession. They came
on the scene with minds, I thought, which
were profoundly independent&mdash;even aggressive.
And I looked forward to an interesting
controversy.</p>

<p>M. Dufrêne was closely examining some
one’s thigh, in which a dark, quivering hole
had been made by a shell.</p>

<p>“What do you put in it, Proby?” he said.</p>

<p>Professor Proby began a detailed explanation
of the way in which such wounds
ought to be treated.</p>

<p>“It has been my habit,” he said, “for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
thirty years to put in some cotton wool&mdash;I
lectured to the Academy of Medicine&mdash;what!
And nothing gives me such good results,
because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At that point the Medical Inspector-General
struck the sick man’s little table
drily with his pencil.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, Proby,” he said, in a calm,
cutting voice.</p>

<p>Proby started a little, and mumbled
again:</p>

<p>“For thirty years I have always used
cotton wool&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Believe me, Proby, that’s enough. You
will not put any of it in the wounds. You
understand.”</p>

<p>M. Dufrêne turned his back and began
examining the next wounded man.</p>

<p>I watched Professor Proby’s face. I was
sure the honoured academician was going to
burst in again. The much-expected scientific
controversy was at last about to take place
before my eyes, and ideas would cross to and
fro like glittering swords. I waited, holding
my breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>In grave silence, the academician replied:</p>

<p>“Very good, <em>Monsieur le médecin inspecteur-général</em>!”</p>

<p>I looked at everybody in turn. It seemed
to me that a glove had been thrown down,
and that some one was going to pick it up
with polite audacity. But everybody looked
vague and attentive. Professor Proby went
up to the Medical Inspector-General, and
repeated mechanically:</p>

<p>“Very good, <em>Monsieur le médecin inspecteur-général</em>!”</p>

<p>The experience of thirty years’ practice
vanished like a light that went out.</p>

<p>M. Dufrêne went from bed to bed, heavy
and majestic. “You made a mistake in
operating upon this man: you would have
done better to wait,” he said. Sometimes
he approved: “Here is a result which justifies
our theories.” Most often his criticism
was unrestrained: “Why didn’t you use
my apparatus&mdash;the Dufrêne apparatus? I
wish to see it used here.”</p>

<p>Then murmurs of assent and promises
were heard. To everything Proby replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
invariably, “<em>Oui, Monsieur le médecin inspecteur-général</em>.”</p>

<p>Doctor Coupé got red and confused in trying
to express appreciations of the Inspector’s
methods that seemed like excuses for his own.</p>

<p>I was watching M. Briavoine: he was
nodding his head unceasingly, and murmured
in a dignified way:</p>

<p>“Obviously, <em>Monsieur le médecin inspecteur-général</em>....
Of course, <em>Monsieur le
médecin inspecteur-général</em>.”</p>

<p>These words were always being repeated
by everybody. They were repeated as a refrain
to almost every syllable and pronounced
with a mumbling mechanical promptitude,
so that every sentence, and every reply,
seemed to end with this ritualistic rhythm:
“<i>Mossinspecteurjral</i>.”</p>

<p>M. Dufrêne, more and more, gave expression
to a kind of triumphant lyric. He
spoke of himself, of his works, with a growing
volubility and frequency. I thought he was
disposed to qualify as “quite French,” or
“national,” and sometimes as “a work of
genius,” methods and ideas which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
strictly his own. But this attempt to
objectify things had a very slight connection
with modesty.</p>

<p>At one moment this towering personality
came towards me without seeing me with such
vehemence that I nimbly got out of the way,
as I would before a train. I uttered hasty
words, which were:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, <em>Monsieur le médecin
inspecteur-général</em>.”</p>

<p>I had never, in the obscure life of a teacher,
had the good fortune to be in the presence of
a military man of high rank and hear him
speak. I had only imagined, or come across
in my reading, the virile outline of the real
old soldier. As I looked at this doctor in his
military boots and listened to his comments,
I repeated to myself: “At last! the real
thing!” I was overwhelmed, crushed, but in
spite of that I was able to enjoy a feeling of
security and confidence, and I always ended
by thinking: “The sheer impudence of it!
Still, it takes some doing to carry it
off like that with such fellows as those
doctors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>The Medical Inspector-General had seized
a fountain pen and was covering the walls
with prescriptions. He explained in emphatic
sentences what decisions ought to
have been made and what action must be
taken. After each diagnosis, those who
attended him chanted the liturgic refrain:
“<em>Oui, Mossinspecteurjral.</em>”</p>

<p>“You must,” he was saying, “remember
that you are soldiers before everything.
In putting on the uniform, you have put on
responsibilities. The independence of science
has to yield before the necessity of a uniform
method. Personal experience has to give way
to discipline.”</p>

<p>With this simple injunction, personal
experience yielded to the sway of discipline.
In one voice the least disciplined race in the
world replied:</p>

<p>“Of course, that is quite understood,
<em>Monsieur le médecin inspecteur-général</em>.”</p>

<p>The spectacled young man was standing
near me, his arms rigidly at attention and
eyes front. I heard him whisper a strange
thing to his neighbour:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“Times have changed: every dog has
his day.”</p>

<p>But his neighbour made a slight gesture
of impatience, and the young man took up
again his stiff attitude of respect.</p>

<p>His remark was quite out of place, I
thought. Yet it got me out of my trance,
and I began to reflect painfully on the
incredible phenomenon which was then
occurring before my eyes.</p>

<p>And it was now entering upon a critical
phase. The inspector was examining the
room where wounds were dressed.</p>

<p>“This room,” he said, “is large and well
arranged. It was altered according to instructions
I made in 1895 when I was reorganising
this hospital. In fact, the whole
place seems fairly satisfactory. Have you
any complaints to make, Coupé?”</p>

<p>Doctor Coupé blushed, was rather upset,
and ended by saying:</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, <em>Mossinspecteurjral</em>.”</p>

<p>M. Briavoine, when asked in his turn,
appeared to ponder, and then replied that
everything was as he wished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>Professor Proby, recovering from his
coma, hastened to stammer:</p>

<p>“Ha! here everything is all right, <em>Mossinspecteurjral</em>.”</p>

<p>I remembered something M. Briavoine
had said. I seemed to see him again buttoning
his linen coat and saying, “What have I
to gain?” Then I looked, greatly astonished,
at his attentive face and respectful bearing.
In the same way I observed his colleagues
and, thinking of these men who had nothing
to gain from their effacement and who had
given way so completely, so hopelessly, I
experienced a great admiration for them, and
I had an insight into the meaning of discipline.
But the perceptions of the intellect are often
betrayed by other less noble impulses, for at
the very same moment I could hardly restrain
an inclination to laugh.</p>

<p>M. Dufrêne had stopped in the middle
of a dormitory. Fifty wounded men were
lying there: some talked in low voices, others
groaned from time to time, and others
again were delirious. The Inspector-General
clapped his hands: at once the silence was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
complete. The least disciplined race in the
world stopped moaning; they ceased from
their delirium.</p>

<p>“Soldiers!” he said in a formidable voice,
“the Government of the Republic has sent
me to you to see how you are looked after.
See how the Government of the Republic
cares for you.”</p>

<p>From one end of the room to the other
heads were raised, necks were stretched,
and all those who had any breath left in
them replied together:</p>

<p>“Thank you, General.”</p>

<p>M. Dufrêne was going out. Behind him,
the least disciplined race in the world followed
in good order down a staircase leading to the
gardens.</p>

<p>I followed too, bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>I was enveloped in the shadows of the
stairs, and before my bewildered eyes interrogation
marks began to dance multicoloured.
They vanished, and I then imagined a theatre
where men appeared in their turn, said
what they had been taught, and arranged
themselves in good and proper order, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
to speak again, others to dance, some to
carry heavy loads, and others to die. Across
the top of the stage a word was engraved
which I could not make out, but which
suddenly became luminous when I heard the
spectacled young man on my right whisper
to his comrade:</p>

<p>“It is a convention&mdash;a great convention
in the midst of all the other conventions
of life. It’s very queer, but not more so
than that which compels us to arrange the
words of a conversation in such or such an
order.”</p>

<p>We were now in the garden. The green
and amber glow of late summer put an
end to one’s dreams.</p>

<p>The inspector had grouped his audience
and was saying:</p>

<p>“You, Coupé, I congratulate you heartily.
And in so doing I am conscious of the real
pleasure I am giving you.”</p>

<p>M. Dufrêne was making no mistake, for
the excellent doctor felt so pleased indeed
that he blushed to the roots of his white
hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>There were other congratulations too,
and also criticisms. Those who had been
praised were surrounded by courtiers. Those
who had been blamed were humiliated and
left alone. Thus Professor Proby could be
seen withdrawing, alone and abashed, like a
schoolboy sent into a corner.</p>

<p>M. Briavoine closed the door of the
motor-car with his own hands. As the
vehicle was about to start, the phenomenon
of the salute was witnessed once more:
left arms to the sides, right arms raised
simultaneously.</p>

<p>The most undisciplined race in the
world stiffened itself into the regulation
attitude.</p>

<p>The motor-car started off with a hoot.</p>

<p>“All the same, he’s a very remarkable
man,” said Doctor Coupé, who seemed to be
still half-asleep. And he repeated: “Yes,
all the same&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He behaved well,” said M. Briavoine.</p>

<p>I noticed the person with the horizontal
beard. His fine growth seemed to point
down towards his chest, but he readjusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
it by a voluntary movement of the chin,
and said:</p>

<p>“Certainly, very well; but I would never
hesitate, on occasion, to tell him exactly
what I thought.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said M. Briavoine, “obedience
should never go to the length of surrendering
your reasoning powers.”</p>

<p>Everybody looked as if he had been doped
with a subtle poison, but was gradually getting
back to consciousness.</p>

<p>The sweet-smelling breeze played over
the grass. I saw fluttering before my eyes
the flighty thistleseed, winged and fleecy.
With a neat little movement M. Briavoine
caught it as he would a fly, and looked at it
absently as he ended his sentence:</p>

<p>“Discipline,” he said, “does not imply,
with us, the suppression of our critical
spirit.”</p>

<p>And I saw, in fact, that the critical spirit
had returned.</p>

<p>The group was disappearing. I was contemplating
the tips of my shoes. The
registers weighed heavily on my arm, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
I tried to understand&mdash;to understand it all,
when a hand struck my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Well! you are not in the guard-room,
my boy! Good! That’s right!”</p>

<p>Purple, apoplectic, the orderly officer
looked at me furiously but there was also
in his eyes a sad, pleading expression. He
added:</p>

<p>“You make your complaint. You’ll see
what’ll happen.”</p>

<p>I raised my eyes towards the hospital.
A clock adorned its front.</p>

<p>Then, clicking my heels together, raising
my right hand to the height of my <em>képi</em>, I
replied quite simply:</p>

<p>“Sir, I am not going to complain. It
is five minutes to twelve. At twelve I shall
be in prison.”</p>

<p>The bulldog face relaxed. I thought he
was going to thank me. He was finally
content to mumble:</p>

<p>“That’s a good thing!”</p>

<p>He went away. I proceeded, without
laughing, to the guard-room.</p>

<p>You know the rest: I passed four days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
and four nights there. It was in the middle
of September. At that time the flower of
the French army were accomplishing such
deeds of valour that an immense feeling of
gratitude seemed to stir the whole country
from end to end. And it was in a prison
that I was fated to offer these men my
humble thanks.</p>

<p>During those four days I thought of
many queer things. But of them I will tell
you another time.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">CUIRASSIER CUVELIER</h2>
</div>


<p>The Cuvelier affair made a deep and
lasting impression on me. M. Poisson
is not a bad man&mdash;far from it! But
he is too old, you know.</p>

<p>All these old men ought not to have been
allowed to take part in the war. You know
what it cost us. And the curious thing
was, sir, that everybody admitted it; for
in the end all these old fellows were sent out
of harm’s way to Limousin, one after the
other. But let’s talk of something else:
this is almost politics, and is no business of
mine.</p>

<p>Talking about M. Poisson, he has one
great fault: he drinks. Apart from that,
as I have told you, he wasn’t a bad sort.
But the stuff a man is made of soon degenerates
by being soaked continually with small
doses, and often large ones too. M. Poisson
drinks, and that’s unfortunate in a man who
fills a responsible post.</p>

<p>What makes him even more peculiar is
that he is not made as we others. He is
in himself a unique type. The world, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
M. Poisson sees it, falls into two classes.
On one side, all those who are above him.
When he is facing that way he salutes and
says, “I understand, <em>mon général</em>; of course,
colonel.” On the other side, all those who
are below him. And when facing them,
he gets purple with shouting, “Silence,
will you!” and things of that kind. At
bottom, I think he is right, and that he
is bound to behave like that in his work.
I repeat he isn’t a bad man&mdash;only timid.
He shouts in order to convince himself he is
not afraid.</p>

<p>But after all, that is a question of army
administration, and it’s no business of mine.
Let us talk of something else. It is a
principle of mine never to speak of these
things: it’s forbidden ground.</p>

<p>But I have a personal grudge against
M. Poisson for having put me in the
mortuary&mdash;I who can write in round hand
or slanting hand, in Gothic or flowing hand,
and a dozen others, and would have made
such a capable secretary.</p>

<p>Just imagine how I was received: I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
arrive with my helmet, knapsack, and all
my rig-out. I am shown into a hut, and
am told: “The doctor is in there.”</p>

<p>At first I see no one. M. Poisson is
buried up to his hair in papers: I can
just hear his asthmatical breathing, like
wind blowing through keyholes. Suddenly he
comes out of his hiding-place, and considers
me. I see a rather heavy old man, short-legged,
not very clean, with black-lined
nails, an excess of skin on the back of the
hand, a freckled skin that overlaps. He
examines me carefully, but behaves as if
he does not see me. I, on my part, look
straight at him and observe him in detail:
on his nose he has little varicose veins, his
cheeks are rather blue, and under his chin
hangs some loose skin, like the snout of
beasts, and beneath his eyes two pouches
that are never still, and brandy-coloured,
which you feel like pricking with a pin.</p>

<p>He looks at me once again, spits, and
says:</p>

<p>“Yes....”</p>

<p>I reply immediately:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“At your service, sir!”</p>

<p>Then he begins to shout in a hoarse voice:</p>

<p>“Speak when you are spoken to. Be
quiet, will you! You see I’m up to my
neck with this offensive, the wounded, and
all these things here.”</p>

<p>What could I reply? I stand at attention
and again say:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; at your service, sir!”</p>

<p>He lights a cigarette and begins to wheeze,
as you may have noticed, from the effects of
alcohol on his chest.</p>

<p>At this juncture an officer comes in.
M. Poisson exclaims:</p>

<p>“It’s you, Perrin? Oh, my dear fellow,
let me alone, will you, to get on with this
job! You see I am tired out with the work.
Just look at my list: nineteen! I’ll never
get to the end! Nineteen!”</p>

<p>The officer takes me by the arm and says:</p>

<p>“Oh! but this is the extra man that has
been sent to us.”</p>

<p>Then M. Poisson comes nearer, looks at
me closely, and bellows, his breath reeking
with alcohol:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Send him to the mortuary! Some one
is wanted there. He can help Tanquerelle.
To the mortuary! And no more nonsense!”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I am stationed at the
mortuary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I became, sir, very wretched. I am
fairly cheerful as a rule, but moving corpses
about all day long cannot be called life.
And such dead! The flower of the country,
degraded to a depth which imagination
cannot fathom.</p>

<p>Tanquerelle is an old butcher’s assistant.
He too drinks. He is always given the
most unpleasant work because he drinks,
and his unpleasant work is an excuse for
giving him more drinks. But I am not going
to expatiate on that. The drink question is
not my business, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Tanquerelle is no company: he is a
calamity, a scourge, a breed apart, so to
speak. When he is hungry, he never speaks;
but he never is hungry. Usually he indulges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
in small talk&mdash;the comments of a drunkard,
painful to hear in the presence of these
corpses.</p>

<p>We are told, sir, that dead bodies mean
very little to one after a time, and that when
you habitually live with them they become
nothing more than stones to you. Well,
that’s not my experience. Every one of
these corpses, with which I pass my days,
ends in being a companion to me.</p>

<p>I get to like some of them, and I am
almost sorry to see them taken away. Sometimes,
when I carelessly hit up against them
with my elbow, it is with an effort that
I do not say, “I beg your pardon, my
friend.” I look at them, with their blistered
hands, and their feet covered with corns
after long trudging over the roads, and my
heart understands and is touched.</p>

<p>I note a flighty ring on a finger, a birthmark
on the skin, an old scar, sometimes
even tattoes, and finally one of the things
which man does not leave behind him:
his poor grey hair, the lines of his face, the
relic of a smile around his eyes, more often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
traces of terror. And all that sets my mind
thinking. From their bodies I can read their
history: I imagined how much they had
worked with those arms, the many things
they had seen with their eyes, how they had
kissed with those lips, how proud they
must have been of their moustache and their
beard, on which now the lice were crawling,
away from the cold, dead flesh. I think of
these things as I sew up the corpses in the
sacking; and the emotion I feel rather
startles me, because mingled with my misery
is a feeling of pleasure.</p>

<p>But I am wandering off into philosophy.
Not being a philosopher, I haven’t the right
to bore you.</p>

<p>I think I was speaking to you about
Cuirassier Cuvelier. Well, let me return to
the story.</p>

<p>It takes us back to the May offensives.
I assure you, I wasn’t idle in those days.
What numbers of dead passed through
my hands! The poor unfortunate widows and
mothers need have no anxiety: in my way,
I did my duty. All of them were taken away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
with their mouths tightly closed with a
chin-cloth, arms crossed on their bodies&mdash;that
is, of course, if they still possessed
mouths and arms&mdash;and I carefully wrapped
them in the sacking. I do not mention
their eyes: it was beyond my power to close
them. It is too late, you know, by the time
they arrive at the mortuary. Oh, I took
good care of my dead!</p>

<p>One day they brought me one with no
identification mark at all. His face was
crushed in; bandages everywhere on his
limbs, but no ticket, no disc on his wrist,
nothing at all.</p>

<p>I placed him on one side, and the doctor
was informed.</p>

<p>In a moment the door opened and M.
Poisson came in.</p>

<p>His deportment was always good after he
had some drink; you could tell it too from
his manner of coughing and spitting and
fingering his cross, for, you know, he was an
Officer of the Legion of Honour.</p>

<p>“You have one too many here,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Sir, I don’t know whether there is one
too many, but there is a body here without
an identification card.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t only that,” replied M. Poisson,
“I see you have eight bodies here. Just
wait a moment....”</p>

<p>He took out of his pocket a rumpled piece
of paper, looking at it from every possible
angle, then he shouted:</p>

<p>“Seven! Seven only! You ought only
to have seven! You fool! Who brought
this corpse here? I don’t want it. It’s
not on the list. Where in the world did
it come from?”</p>

<p>I began to tremble, and replied stammering:</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice which section brought
it here.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You didn’t notice! And what do
you think I’m going to do with it? Now,
what is the man’s name?”</p>

<p>“But, sir, that’s just what I want to
know. He hasn’t been identified.”</p>

<p>“Not identified! Now we’re in for it.
You’ll hear again of this from me. It simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
won’t do. To begin with, come along with
me at once!”</p>

<p>We go from hut to hut, M. Poisson
asking at each door:</p>

<p>“Did any of you send us a body without
identification papers?”</p>

<p>You can well imagine that when asked
in this way all M. Poisson’s men took cover
immediately. Some laughed secretly: others
were alarmed. All made the same reply:</p>

<p>“A dead body without identification
papers! Certainly not, Doctor; we never
brought it.”</p>

<p>M. Poisson began to breathe heavily.</p>

<p>He spat everywhere; he was so angry
that his voice was no longer human&mdash;it was
hoarse, ragged and torn. In spite of his
insufferable temper, I actually felt pity for
the old man.</p>

<p>Back he goes to the office, I following close
at his heels. Dashing to his papers and
documents, he shuffles them about like a
spaniel in the mud. Then, shouting angrily,
he says:</p>

<p>“Here you are!&mdash;1236 came in; 561 have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
gone out. Do you understand? Six remain
at present. That’s it: one is missing, and
it must be the one. And nobody knows
who he is! We are in a mess! We are
in a mess!”</p>

<p>I confess that M. Poisson’s assurance
made a great impression on me. Especially
was I surprised at the accuracy of his figures.
It is wonderful, sir, to note the efficiency
of military organisation. We learn, for instance,
that twenty-three stretchers out of a
hundred have been lost&mdash;not one more, not
one less; or 1000 wounded were brought
in; 50 died; therefore 950 are still alive.
To maintain this mathematical order, it is
therefore clearly well worth while taking
the trouble to make a list of everything
that comes in and goes out. Listening to
M. Poisson making his calculation, I saw,
too clearly, how my poor unfortunate corpse
was one too many.</p>

<p>The doctor repeated, “We are in a
mess,” and added, “Now, you there! Come
along with me.”</p>

<p>M. Poisson bustled off again in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
directions, to the left and to the right. I
followed him, my head lowered, having
been gradually seized by the fever that
tortured him. He stopped all the officers.</p>

<p>“I’m fed up with this job! Go and see
if the body wasn’t sent out from your huts.”</p>

<p>He entered the operating theatres and
asked the surgeons:</p>

<p>“You didn’t send me an unidentified
dead body?”</p>

<p>And every time he took out his rumpled
piece of paper and added a cross, a number,
with his pencil.</p>

<p>Towards evening he fixed me with another
look. There were red patches underneath
his eyes as highly coloured as raw ham.</p>

<p>“You!&mdash;go back to the mortuary! You’ll
hear more of me yet!”</p>

<p>I went back, and sat down, feeling very
wretched. Three fresh corpses had been
brought in. Tanquerelle was hoisting them
into coffins with the help of the carpenter.</p>

<p>On the table, temporarily shrouded in
tent material, the unknown dead man was
waiting his fate. Tanquerelle was completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
drunk and was singing “The Missouri,”&mdash;not
exactly the thing to do in the midst
of corpses. I went and drew aside the
shroud and looked at the ice-cold body.
His smashed face was covered with linen
bandages. A few locks of fair hair could
be seen. As for the rest, just an ordinary
body, like yours or mine, sir.</p>

<p>Night had fallen. The door opened and
M. Poisson, accompanied by another officer,
appeared with a lantern. He seemed calm
and replete, like a man who has dined
well.</p>

<p>“You are an idiot,” he said to me.
“Why couldn’t you see that this was the
body of Cuirassier Cuvelier?”</p>

<p>“But, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up! It’s Cuirassier Cuvelier.”</p>

<p>Coming up to the table, he noted the
size of the corpse and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Of course! He’s tall enough to be
a cuirassier. You see, Perrin, Cuvelier
was brought in the day before yesterday.
According to the register, he was not taken
out. As he is no longer under treatment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
he is dead, and this must be he. That’s
clear.”</p>

<p>“Obviously,” said Perrin, “it’s he right
enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes; don’t you agree?” replied M.
Poisson. “It’s Cuvelier; that is quite plain.
Poor devil! Now we can go to bed....”</p>

<p>Then he turned towards me:</p>

<p>“You!&mdash;you will put him in the coffin,
and stick on the lid: ‘Cuvelier, Edouard,
9th Cuirassiers.’ And then, you mind! no
more pranks of this kind.”</p>

<p>When the officers had gone, I put Cuirassier
Cuvelier in a coffin, and then I lay
down for a few hours on my mattress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning I was preparing to
nail down the coffin of Edouard Cuvelier,
when I saw M. Poisson coming up once
again. His face was not so calm as on the
previous evening.</p>

<p>“Wait; don’t bury that man yet,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>He walked round the coffin, and nibbled
the end of a cigarette; he appeared indeed
so uneasy that I knew at once he had not
yet decided to thrust Cuvelier out into
the abyss. It was not going to be done: the
dead body was getting in the way and refused
to be swallowed up. I don’t know whether
M. Poisson had a high idea of his duty, or
merely was afraid of complications; whatever
it was, I sympathised greatly with him
at that moment.</p>

<p>He turned towards me and, as he did
not like to be alone, “Come along with me,”
he said.</p>

<p>Off we went again, making the round of
the huts.</p>

<p>“Hut No. 8?” began M. Poisson. “The
seriously wounded are here, aren’t they? Is
Cuirassier Cuvelier here?”</p>

<p>The men there made inquiries, and replied
“No.”</p>

<p>We went on to the next.</p>

<p>M. Poisson began again:</p>

<p>“Hut No. 7? Have you here a
man named Cuvelier, of the 9th Cuirassiers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>“No, <em>Monsieur le médecin-chef</em>.”</p>

<p>M. Poisson was delighted with his success.</p>

<p>“Of course! They can’t have him,
because he’s dead. I am doing this to
satisfy my conscience. I’m made like that.”</p>

<p>We met M. Perrin.</p>

<p>“You see, Perrin,” said the doctor, “in
order to be quite sure, I am looking in every
hut to see if a Cuvelier may not be anywhere.
And I can’t find a man of that name. Of
course, I only look where the seriously
wounded are quartered. I am not a fool.
If he is dead, he must have been seriously
wounded.”</p>

<p>“Obviously,” said M. Perrin.</p>

<p>After we had been to all the huts, M.
Poisson held himself very proudly, causing
many folds in the loose flesh under his chin,
and he concluded by saying:</p>

<p>“It’s Cuvelier, sure enough. Now you
see what it is to have order. With me it’s
not the same as with Ponce and Vieillon,
who are awful bunglers.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” M. Perrin said, “you would be
wise to inquire among the lightly wounded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! well, if you think so,” said M.
Poisson, rather indifferently.</p>

<p>And we proceeded to the huts of the
“quick removals.” We went in, and asked
the usual question. No one replied. On
going out, M. Poisson repeated:</p>

<p>“Cuvelier isn’t here?”</p>

<p>Then suddenly we heard some one shouting:</p>

<p>“Yes; Cuvelier, present!”</p>

<p>And a tall, curly-headed man jumps
off a bed, raising a hand that was very
lightly bandaged....</p>

<p>Things take a tragic turn. M. Poisson
turns dark purple, like a man stricken with
apoplexy. He spits two or three times.
He smacks his thighs, and says in a choking
voice:</p>

<p>“God! he must be alive then!”</p>

<p>“I am Cuvelier,” the soldier remarks.</p>

<p>“Cuvelier, Edouard?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Edouard!”</p>

<p>“Of the 9th Cuirassiers?”</p>

<p>“That’s right: of the ‘9th Cuir’!”</p>

<p>M. Poisson goes out like a madman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
followed by M. Perrin and myself. He goes
to the mortuary, and he stands before the
coffin, dribbles on his tunic, and says quite
shortly:</p>

<p>“If it’s not Cuvelier, we have to begin
all over again.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ah, sir! what a day it was!</p>

<p>The offensive was going on during that
time. The dead were filling the place which
had been reserved for them. But the very
life of the service seemed to have been held
up.</p>

<p>You have seen ships come to a stop in
the middle of a river and holding up all the
traffic? Well, this unknown corpse gave that
impression. It was stranded right across
our work and began to upset everything,
beginning with the health of the unfortunate
M. Poisson, who suggested taking sick leave.</p>

<p>Every hour he came and glanced at
the body, which was beginning slowly to
decompose. He stared at it stolidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>During the afternoon I had a moment’s
rest while M. Poisson took his siesta. About
six he came again, and I hardly recognised
him. His hands were almost clean, he wore
a white collar, his beard was trimmed, and
his breath like that of a man who has just
rinsed his mouth in <em>vieux marc</em>.</p>

<p>“What!” he said, “you haven’t yet
closed down the German’s coffin! You are
an incapable ass!”</p>

<p>“But, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue! And write this
inscription, and be quick!&mdash;‘An unknown
German.’ D’you understand?”</p>

<p>M. Perrin had just come in. The two
officers had one more look at the corpse.</p>

<p>“It’s obviously a Boche,” said M. Poisson.</p>

<p>“Yes; look at his fair hair.”</p>

<p>“Perrin, you ought to have thought of
it sooner,” added the doctor.</p>

<p>The officers were about to go out, when
M. Poisson turned round and said:</p>

<p>“Take the thing out of the coffin; since
he’s a German, put him in the earth as he
is, with all the other Huns.”</p>



<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">CIVILISATION</h2>
</div>


<p>I must know first what you mean
by civilisation. That is a question
I can well put to a man of understanding
and intelligence like yourself; and
then, too, you are always boasting of this
famous civilisation.</p>

<p>Before the war I was an assistant in
a commercial laboratory; but now I swear
that, if ever I have the doubtful privilege
of surviving this horror, I will never take
up the work again. The country&mdash;the pure,
fresh country for me! Anywhere away
from these filthy factories&mdash;far from the
roar of your aeroplanes and all the
machinery in which formerly I took an
interest when I did not understand things;
but which horrify me now because I see
in them the very spirit of the war&mdash;the
principle and the cause of the war.</p>

<p>I hate the twentieth century as I hate
this degenerate Europe&mdash;as I hate the world
which Europe has polluted. I know it
may seem ridiculous&mdash;this high talk. But
what do I care! I’m not speaking to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
crowd, and besides I might as well be laughed
at for this as for anything else. I repeat,
I shall fly to the hills, and I shall see to
it that I am as much alone as I possibly
can be. I had thought of escaping among
the savages, but there are no real savages
now. <em>They</em> are all riding bicycles and
clamouring for medals and honours....
I am not going to live with the savages&mdash;we
have done our best to corrupt them:
I have seen it done too well at Soissons.</p>

<p>In the spring of this year I was at
Soissons with the G.B.C. I see that G.B.C.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
rather mystifies you, but you must blame
civilisation for that: the Tower of Babel is
being rebuilt by it, and soon we shall have
so debased our mother tongue that it will be
nothing more than a telegraphic code, ugly
and colourless.</p>

<p>The retreat of the Germans had taken
the line back towards Vauxaillon and Laffaux,
and there fighting went on pretty vigorously.
In one sector there was a spot&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
Laffaux mill&mdash;which was a veritable
thorn in a wound, keeping it always inflamed.
About the beginning of May a
great attack was launched on the mill, and
nearly the whole of my division had to
turn out on field duty.</p>

<p>“You, sergeant,” said one officer to me&mdash;“you
will remain at the hospital and take
charge of the A.C.A.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> section. I’ll send a
number of men to help you.”</p>

<p>I was by this time thoroughly conversant
with the subtleties of military speech.
When I was told that a number of men
were to be put under my charge, I understood
perfectly that there would be no one;
and in point of fact I was given four miserable
outcasts&mdash;weak, half-imbecile creatures
of no use to any one.</p>

<p>From Saturday onwards the wounded
arrived in batches of a hundred. I got them
arranged as methodically as I could in the
wards of the A.C.A.</p>

<p>But the work was not going on at all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>well. My absurd stretcher-bearers, unable
to fall in with each other’s movements,
stumbled like broken-kneed, miserable nags,
causing the wounded to scream with pain.
In a nibbling, haphazard sort of way, they
tried to deal with the waiting masses of the
injured, and the whole A.C.A. seemed to
stamp with impatience. The effect was
rather like a human meat factory which
has its machinery going at full strength
without being fed with oil and materials.</p>

<p>I must really describe the A.C.A. to you.
In war slang it means an automatic hospital
(“autochir”)&mdash;the latest thing in surgical
invention. It’s the last word in science,
just like our 400 m.m. calibre guns which
run on metal rails: it follows the armies
with motors, steam-driven machinery, microscopes,
laboratories, the complete equipment
of a modern hospital. It is the first
great repair depôt which the wounded man
enters on coming out of the destructive,
grinding mill on the extreme front. Here
are brought the parts of the military machine
that are most spoiled. Skilled workmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
take them in hand at once, loosen them
quickly, and with a practised eye examine
them, as one would a hydro-pneumatic
break, an ignition chamber or a collimator.
If the part is seriously damaged, it goes
through the usual routine of being scrapped;
but if the “human material” is not irretrievably
ruined, it is patched up ready to
be used again at the first opportunity, and
that is called “preserving the effectives.”</p>

<p>My stretcher-bearers, with the jolting
clumsiness of drunken dockers, were bringing
to the A.C.A. a few of the injured, who were
at once swallowed up and eliminated. And
the factory continued to growl, like some
Moloch whose appetite has been whetted
by the fumes of the first sacrifice.</p>

<p>I had picked up a stretcher. Helped
by a gunner who had been wounded in
the neck, and whose only desire was to be
of some use while awaiting his operation,
I led my crew in amongst the heap of
men that lay on the ground. It was then
that I saw some one passing along wearing
a high-grade officer’s hat&mdash;a sensible sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
of man who smiled in spite of his solicitous
bearing.</p>

<p>“There is something wrong with your
ambulance work,” he said. “I’ll send you
eight negroes. They are excellent stretcher
men, these fellows from Madagascar.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterwards the negroes had
come.</p>

<p>To be exact, they were not all natives
of Madagascar: they were types selected
from the 1st Colonial Corps which was at
that very moment strenuously fighting before
Laffaux. There were a few natives of the
Soudan, whose age was difficult to tell,
sombre and wrinkled, and concealing under
their regimental tunics charms that were
coated with dirt, and smelling with leather,
sweat and exotic oils. The negroes of Madagascar
were of medium height, looking like
embryos, very dark and silent.</p>

<p>They slipped on the straps, and at my
command began carrying the wounded with
quiet unconcern, as if they were unloading
bales of cotton at the docks.</p>

<p>I was content, or rather reassured. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
A.C.A., surfeited at last, worked at high
pressure, and hummed like well-tended
machines that drip with oil, shining and
flashing from every point.</p>

<p>Flash! The word is not too strong.
I was dazzled on entering the operating
hut. Night had just fallen&mdash;one of those
warm beautiful nights of this brutal spring.
The gunfire came and went in short spasms,
like a sick giant. The wards of the hospital
overflowed with a heaving mass of pain,
and death was trying to restore order there.
I breathed in deeply the night air of the
garden and, as I was saying, I entered the
operating hut.</p>

<p>It had been partitioned off into several
rooms. The one I suddenly stepped into
made a bulge in the side of the building.
It was as hot as a puddling-oven. Men
were cleaning, scrubbing, and polishing, with
scrupulous care, a mass of shining instruments,
while others were stoking fires which
gave out the white heat of soldering lamps.
With never a pause, orderlies were coming
and going, carrying trays held out rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
stiffly at arm’s length, like hotel-keepers
devoted to the ceremonious rites of the table.</p>

<p>“It’s warm here,” I murmured, in order
to say something.</p>

<p>“Come over here: you’ll find it all right,”
said a grinning little chap as hairy as a
kobold.</p>

<p>I lifted a lid, feeling I was opening the
breast of some monster. In front of me
steps led to a kind of throne on which,
seated like a king, the heart of the thing
was to be found. It was a steriliser&mdash;an
immense pot in which a calf could easily
have been cooked whole. It lay on its
stomach and emitted a jet of steam that
stupefied one, and its weary monotony made
one hardly conscious of time and space.
But suddenly the infernal noise stopped, and
it was like the end of eternity. On the back
of the machine a load of kettles continued
to spit and gurgle. A man looking like a
ship’s pilot was turning a large heavy wheel,
and the lid of the cauldron, suddenly unbolted,
rose, exposing to view its red-hot
bowels, from which all sorts of boxes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
packages were taken out. The heat of the
furnace had given way to the damp, crushing
atmosphere of a drying-stove.</p>

<p>“But where do they operate on the
wounded?” I asked a boy who was washing
a pair of rubber gloves in a big copper tub.</p>

<p>“Over there, in the operating-room, of
course. But don’t go in that way.”</p>

<p>I went out again into the freshness of
the night, and proceeded to the waiting-room
to find my stretcher-bearers.</p>

<p>At that moment it was the turn of the
cuirassiers to be brought in. A division of
“foot cavalry” had been fighting since
morning. Hundreds of the finest men in
France had fallen, and they waited there
like broken statues which are still beautiful
in their ruins. Their limbs were so strong,
and their chests so solid, that they could
not believe in death, and as they felt their
rich healthy blood dripping from their
wounds, they held at bay, with curses and
laughter, the weakness of their broken flesh.</p>

<p>“They can do what they like with
this flesh of mine,” said one of the two;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
“but to make me unconscious, damn me!
I’m not having any.”</p>

<p>“Yes, whatever they like,” said another,
“but not amputation! I want my paw;
even done to the world, I want it!”</p>

<p>These two men were coming out of
the X-ray ward. They lay naked under a
sheet, and carried, pinned to their bandages,
papers of different sizes and shapes, rough
sketches, formulæ, and something like an
algebraical statement of their wounds, the
expression in numbers of their misery and
disordered organs.</p>

<p>They spoke of this their first visit to the
laboratory like clever children who realise
that the modern world would not know
how to live or die without the meticulous
discipline of the sciences.</p>

<p>“What did he say, the X-rays major?”</p>

<p>“He said it was an antero-posterior axis.”</p>

<p>“Just what I feared.”</p>

<p>“It’s in my belly. I heard him say
<em>abdomen</em>. But I am sure it’s in my belly.
Ah, damn it! but I’m not going to be put
to sleep. That I won’t stand!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>The door of the operating theatre opened
at this point, and the waiting-room was
flooded with light. A voice cried:</p>

<p>“The next lot! And the belly chap
first!”</p>

<p>The black bearers adjusted their straps,
and the two talkers were carried off. I
followed the stretchers.</p>

<p>Imagine a shining rectangular block set
in sheer night like a jewel in coal. The
door closed again, and I found myself imprisoned
in that light, which was reflected
from the spotless canvas of the ceiling.
The floor, level and springy, was strewn
with red soaked linen which the orderlies
picked up quickly with forceps. Between
the floor and the ceiling, four strange forms
that were men. They were dressed completely
in white, their faces hidden behind
masks which, like those of Touareg, only
admit the eyes to view. Like Chinese dancers,
they held in the air their hands covered
with rubber, and the perspiration streamed
from their brows.</p>

<p>You could hear the muffled vibrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
of the motor which generated the light.
Filled up again to overflowing, the steriliser
disturbed the world with its piercing lament.
Small radiators were snorting like animals
when they are stroked the wrong way.
It all made a savage, flamboyant music,
and the men who were moving about seemed
to perform rhythmically a religious dance&mdash;a
kind of austere and mysterious ballet.</p>

<p>The stretchers glided in between the
tables like canoes in an archipelago. The
instruments were set out on spotless linen
and sparkled like jewels in glass cases;
and the little Madagascar negroes, alert
and obedient, took great care in handling
their burden. They stopped on the word of
command, and waited. Their dark slender
necks yoked with the straps, and their fingers
clutching the handles of the stretchers,
reminded one of sacred apes trained to
carry idols. The heads and feet of the two
wan and enormous cuirassiers stuck out
beyond the limits of the stretchers.</p>

<p>A few gestures that were almost ritualistic,
and the wounded men were placed
on the operating-tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>At that moment I caught the eye of one
of the negroes, and I experienced a feeling
of extreme discomfort. It was the calm
deep look of a child or a young dog. The
savage was slowly turning his head from
left to right and looked at the extraordinary
men and the extraordinary things all around
him. His dark eyes stopped lightly on all
the wonderful parts of this workshop devoted
to repairing the human machine. And
those eyes, which betrayed no thought,
were on that account even more disquieting.
For one second I was fool enough to think
“How astonished he must be!” But the
absurd thought soon left me, and I was
overwhelmed with unutterable shame.</p>

<p>The four negroes left the room. That
afforded me a little comfort. The wounded
looked dazed and bewildered. The ambulance
men hastened to bind their hands
and feet and rub them with alcohol. The
masked men were giving orders and moving
about the tables with the deliberate gestures
of officiating priests.</p>

<p>“Who is the head here?” I whispered
to some one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>He was pointed out to me. He was
a man of medium height and was sitting
down, with his gloved hands held up, dictating
something to a clerk.</p>

<p>Fatigue, the blinding light, the booming
of the guns, the rumble of the machinery
acted as a sort of lucid drug on my brain.
I remained fixed where I was, in a veritable
whirl of thought. Everything here worked
for one’s good ... it was civilisation finding
within itself the supreme reply, the
corrective to its destructive excesses; nothing
less than this complex organism would suffice
to reduce by the smallest degree the immense
evil creation of the machine age. I thought
again of the indecipherable look of the savage,
and my emotion was a mixture of pity, anger
and loathing....</p>

<p>The man who, as I had learnt, was in
charge of the operating theatre had finished
dictating. He remained fixed in the position
of a heraldic messenger and seemed
to be absorbed in thought. I noticed that
behind his spectacles gleamed a look that
was solemn, tranquil and sad, though full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
of purpose. Scarcely anything of his face
was visible, the mask hiding his mouth and
beard; but on his temples could be seen
a few fresh grey hairs, and a large swollen
vein marked his forehead, betraying the
strained efforts of a tense will.</p>

<p>“The man’s unconscious,” said some one.</p>

<p>The surgeon approached the table.
The man had indeed lost consciousness;
and I saw it was the very one who swore
he would not take the anæsthetic. The
poor man had not dared even to make a
protest. Caught, as it were, in the cogs
of the wheel, he was at once overpowered,
and he delivered himself up to the hungry
machine, like pig-iron devoured by the
rolling-mills. And then, too, he must have
known it was for his good, because this is
all the good that is left to us in these days.</p>

<p>“Sergeant,” some one remarked, “you
are not allowed to remain in the operating
theatre without a cap.”</p>

<p>On going out, I looked once again at
the surgeon. He hung over his work with
an assiduity in which, despite his overalls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
his mask and his gloves, a feeling of
tenderness was plainly marked.</p>

<p>I thought with conviction: “No! No!
He, at least, has no illusions!”</p>

<p>And I found myself once more in the
waiting-room, that smelt of blood, like a
wild beast’s lair.</p>

<p>A dim light came from a veiled lamp.
Some wounded were moaning; others chatted
in low voices.</p>

<p>“Who said tank?” said one of them.
“Why, I was wounded in a tank.”</p>

<p>There was silence, brief and respectful.
The man, who was buried in bandages,
added:</p>

<p>“Our petrol-tank burst: my legs are
broken and I am burnt in the face. Oh!
I know all about tanks!”</p>

<p>He said that with a queer emphasis in
which I recognised the age-long torment of
humanity&mdash;pride.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I went out into the night to enjoy a
smoke. The world seemed to be dazed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
bewildered, tragic; and I think that in
reality....</p>

<p>Believe me, sir, when I speak of civilisation
and regret it, I quite know what I
am saying; and it is not wireless telegraphy
that will alter my opinion. It is all the
more tragic because we are helpless; we
cannot reverse the course which the world
is taking. And yet!</p>

<p>Civilisation&mdash;the true civilisation&mdash;exists.
I think often of it. In my mind it is the
harmony of a choir chanting a hymn; it is
a marble statue on an arid, burnt-up hillside;
it is the Man who said, “Love one
another,” or “Return good for evil.” But
for two thousand years these phrases
have been merely repeated, and the chief
priests have too much vested interest in
temporal things to conceive anything of the
kind.</p>

<p>We are mistaken about happiness and
about good. The noblest natures have also
been mistaken, for silence and solitude are
too often denied them. I have seen the
monstrous steriliser on its throne. I tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
you, of a truth, civilisation is not to be found
there any more than in the shining forceps
of the surgeon. Civilisation is not in this
terrible trumpery; and if it is not in the
heart of man, then it exists nowhere.</p>

<p class="center ">Crown 8vo. 6<em>s.</em> net.</p>

<p><em>This</em> powerful and much-discussed novel, though
written in the winter of 1917, could not be published
until recently owing to the action of the Censors. It is
a study of the character of two brothers, both of whom
are faithful to their ideals&mdash;the one dying on the field of
battle, and the other falling a victim to his harsh treatment
in prison as a Conscientious Objector. The story
has been splendidly received, and the whole press has
joined in condemning in most indignant terms the folly
of the Press Bureau in withholding the book so long
from circulation. Mr. Begbie himself, in a vigorous
Preface, gives a detailed account of his negotiations with
the Authorities, and this lends additional interest to what
is not only a fascinating novel, but a work that will
possess much historical value to the future student of
England during the Great War.</p>

and immediately upon the recognition of the humanity of Labour.
As soon as we rid ourselves of the notion that Labour is something

labour-power, it is at once evident that all the arguments in

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
